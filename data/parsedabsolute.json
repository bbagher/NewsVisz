[{"title":"U.S. regulators to rate new auto tech, but Europe leads in safety testing","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'5 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - Autopilot"," Super Cruise and Drive Pilot are different names given to technology that automates steering and braking in a growing number of vehicles"," but none of it can safely “pilot” cars without regular human intervention.  '","'These systems and the potential for consumers to misunderstand and misuse them are putting pressure on  regulators everywhere to overhaul safety testing and consumer rating systems that have not kept up with the pace of deployment of new semi-automated driving technology. '","'That may be especially true in the United States"," where the National Transportation Safety Board chided regulators this week for lagging their European counterparts in efforts to ensure consumer and road safety. '","'The acting head of the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said on Wednesday that his agency would make changes this year to a testing program that assigns safety grades to new and future vehicles. '","'“We’re raising the bar for safety technologies in our new vehicles","” said acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief James Owens.  '","'NHTSA in December 2015 issued proposed rulemaking for testing procedures that would be similar to more comprehensive testing done by European regulators. '","'No rules have been put forward since then"," however"," and    Owens’ comments came a day after the NTSB sharply criticized NHTSA for its hands off approach to overseeing semi-automated driving technology. The NTSB"," an independent U.S. government agency"," also compared NHTSA’s testing and ratings unfavorably to consumer safety systems put in place by European agencies.[nL1N2AP0SD] '","'Surveys have shown that consumers overestimate the capabilities of semi-automated systems"," as automakers race to deliver on the promise of truly driverless cars. Safety advocates also criticize manufacturers for using misleading terms to market those systems"," including Autopilot"," Pro Pilot Assist and Traffic Jam Pilot. '","'European regulators have been expanding their rules and ratings to evaluate new technology such as automatic braking and lane-keeping"," while U.S. regulators have done little to change their traditional “five star” crash test grading system. '","'European safety ratings assess all advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) currently available and regulators have passed some laws on the technology. '","'In 2018"," European Union regulators required the installation of acoustic and visual warning signals for lane-keeping systems every 15 seconds if drivers take their hands off the wheel. '","'As a result"," Tesla ('","') had to issue a software update to its Autopilot system in the EU. '","'A regulatory body is currently working on rules for more advanced hands-off systems that can control braking"," acceleration and lane changes at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph). '","'Under draft EU rules"," carmakers among other things need to show how the system safely hands control back to the driver"," how the car monitors the road and how it reacts in emergency situations. '","'Pressure on automakers in Europe also comes from non-binding performance ratings by Europe’s New Car Assessment Program"," known in the industry as Euro NCAP. '","'Euro NCAP began rating automatic braking systems in 2014. It is testing the performance of advanced cruise control"," lane-centering systems and blind spot detection since 2018 and beginning in May will also grade how well a car’s system is keeping the driver engaged. '","'The group is a non-governmental body but funded by some EU countries and also receives money from national motor clubs and insurers. Matthew Avery"," a Euro NCAP board member"," said the group was sharing testing methods with NHTSA and the NTSB on a regular basis. '","'As regulation moves slowly"," Euro NCAP plays a crucial role in holding carmakers accountable"," Avery said. '","'“The manufacturers initially scream blue murder and say our targets are impossible to achieve"," but then one of them does it and everyone follows","” he said. '","'Carmakers in the United States are allowed to self-certify that their vehicles comply with existing rules"," said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith"," who focuses on automated driving. But there are currently no rules for ADAS. '","'NHTSA also publishes an annual New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)"," which evaluates the crashworthiness of a vehicle and outlines what semi-automated features a car comes with. But the agency does not assess the safety of those systems despite nearly all modern cars being equipped with some features like automatic emergency braking.

Nio’s $1.4 bln lifeline may pave a smoother road","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'3 Min Read'","'HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s Tesla might finally clear some roadblocks. Nio has tapped everyone from founder William Li to China’s Tencent for funding since its debut in late 2018. But the U.S.-listed company remains cash-strapped. Now it says it is close to securing $1.4 billion from the municipal government of Hefei in Anhui. Similar past agreements have failed to materialise but this one"," with official ties"," is a more promising potential pillar of support.  '","'Investors will have a sense of déjà vu. In May"," the company said it had snagged a similar amount from Beijing E-Town"," a state-backed group. Shares rallied"," but the money is yet to arrive. There was another flurry of excitement earlier this year when Chinese media reported a further $1 billion on the way from Guangzhou Automobile – but it turns out that the final sum may be under $150 million. '","'The latest announcement has more substance"," partly because it builds on an existing relationship with Anhui’s homegrown automaker JAC. The state-owned group is already Nio’s manufacturing partner"," and it is in their interests for the young company to prosper. The deal would see the group establish its Nio China headquarters in the region"," and a press release describing a signing ceremony attended by local officials and JAC’s chairman provide some extra credibility.  '","'Shares rose 13% on the disclosure but there is scant detail on how the funding will be structured. A sum of $1.4 billion is equivalent to about one third of Nio’s current market cap. Bernstein’s analysts expect that the Hefei government could take a significant share of entity Nio China"," giving existing owners less share of future revenues and cash flow.  '","'Although the headline sum is enough to wipe out the listed company’s net debt"," which stood at just over $1 billion at the end of the third quarter"," Nio will still need to grapple with weak demand. And leverage may continue to grow: total borrowings increased more than 440% in the year to September 2019. The company earlier had net cash.  '","'A fundraising deal may pave a smoother road but existing shareholders will pay for the support. '","'Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday sharply criticized Tesla Inc.’s lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California and called U.S. regulators’ approach in overseeing the driver assistance systems “misguided.” '","'NTSB board members questioned Tesla’s design of its semi-automated driving assistance system and condemned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for a “hands-off approach” to regulating the increasingly popular systems. '","'NHTSA has “taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety” and should “complete a further evaluation of the Tesla Autopilot system to ensure the deployed technology does not pose an unreasonable safety risk","” NTSB said. '","'The board faulted Apple Inc and other smartphone makers for refusing to disable devices when users are driving. It also called on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use its authority to take action “against “employers who fail to address the hazards of distracted driving.” '","'The board’s criticism posed a direct challenge to the auto industry’s efforts to profit from partially automated vehicles and the smartphone industry’s quest to keep user eyes on their devices. '","'The NTSB can only make recommendations"," while NHTSA regulates U.S. vehicles. NHTSA has sent teams to investigate 14 Tesla crashes in which Autopilot is suspected of being in use"," but taken no action against the company. '","'Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention"," but cannot completely replace human drivers. '","'“It’s time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars. Because they don’t have driverless cars","” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said. '","'The Mountain View"," California crash - involving a driver who was playing a game on his phone during the fatal trip - illustrates “semi-autonomous vehicles can lead drivers to be complacent... and it also points out that smartphones manipulating them"," can be so addictive"," that people aren’t going to put them down","” Sumwalt added. '","'Walter Huang"," a 38-year-old Apple software engineer"," was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and recovered logs showed a word-building game was active. '","'The probable cause of Huang’s crash was Autopilot steering the vehicle off the highway “due to system limitations"," and the driver’s lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance” on Autopilot"," the NTSB said. Huang on prior trips had intervened when Autopilot steered the vehicle toward the same “highway gore” area.  '","'NHTSA said it will carefully review the NTSB’s recommendations. The agency added that commercial motor vehicles “require the human driver to be in control at all times.” '","'Tesla drivers are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot"," but Tesla advises keeping hands on the wheel and paying attention. '","'Sumwalt said Tesla allowed drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for up to three minutes under certain conditions when using Autopilot.  '","'The NTSB said Tesla added safeguards to require quicker warnings at higher speeds for drivers without hands on the wheel. '","'Regulators in Europe place limitations on Autopilot use and Tesla issues alerts there for hands-off driving within 15 seconds"," the NTSB said. '","'Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. '","'NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg called Autopilot “completely inadequate” and noted Tesla vehicles have repeatedly crashed into large obstacles.  '","'Sumwalt said Tesla - unlike five other auto manufacturers - has ignored NTSB safety recommendations issued in 2017. '","'Tesla’s Autopilot is tied to at least three deadly crashes since 2016 and suspected in others. '","'The NTSB will release in coming days the probable cause of a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Florida that showed no evidence the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds before striking a semi-trailer truck. '","'The NTSB also called on cellphone manufacturers to add more safeguards to prevent the misuse of devices by drivers. '","'Sumwalt noted that Apple does not have a distracted driving policy"," but said it should have one. Apple says it expects its employees to follow the law.

'","'The safety board is expected to issue recommendations to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)"," Tesla and a California transportation agency"," the sources said.

California had failed to repair the attenuator after a crash 11 days before the one involving Huang. The attenuator is designed to absorb crash forces before a vehicle hits a concrete median barrier. '","'Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco said on Monday the agency “is implementing several steps to enhance monitoring and tracking of the repair of damage to highway infrastructure.” The efforts include “enhanced reporting on the timely repair of high priority traffic safety devices.” '","'The NTSB said earlier that Huang’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the fatal crash.

'","'The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and logs recovered show a word-building game was active during Huang’s fatal trip.

Tesla in talks to use CATL's cobalt-free batteries in China-made cars - sources","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'3 Min Read'","'Beijing (Reuters) - Tesla ('","') is in advanced stages of talks to use batteries from CATL ('","') that contain no cobalt - one of the most expensive metals in electric vehicle (EV) batteries - in cars made at its China plant"," people familiar with the matter said. '","'Adoption would mark the first time for the U.S. automaker to include so-called lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in its lineup"," as it seeks to lower production costs amid faltering overall EV sales in China. '","'Tesla has been talking to the Chinese manufacturer for more than a year to supply LFP batteries that will be cheaper than its existing batteries by a “double-digit percent","” said a person directly involved in the matter"," who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified. '","'Tesla Inc and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) declined to comment. '","'EV manufacturers usually use nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries on passenger vehicles because of their higher energy density"," which is critical in determining how far an EV can drive on single charge. '","'To boost the density and safety of its LFP batteries"," CATL has been working on its so-called cell-to-pack technology"," the people told Reuters. '","'It was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use LFP batteries but the automaker has no plans to stop using its current NCA batteries"," said one of the people. '","'Tesla has been ramping up production of its Model 3 cars at its newly built $2 billion Shanghai plant and cutting prices to win market share from conventional premium automakers such as Germany’s BMW AG ('","') and Daimler AG ('","'). '","'Tesla started to deliver cars from the factory in December"," helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models. It is currently seeking regulatory approval to make longer-range Model 3 cars at the plant. '","'Sales in China of new energy vehicles - referring to battery-only"," plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles - likely sank 54.4% in January"," industry data showed"," due in part to the Lunar New Year holiday starting earlier than last year as well as the impact of the outbreak in China of a new coronavirus. '","'The use of LFP batteries will also help Chief Executive Elon Musk meet a 2018 promise that Tesla would cut the use of cobalt - which costs some $33","500 a tonne - to “almost nothing”. '","'Tesla plans to host a battery event"," probably in April"," to share its future battery strategy and technology"," Musk said at an earnings conference in January.

'","'The moves will accelerate GM’s retreat from unprofitable markets"," making it more dependent on the United States"," China"," Latin America and South Korea"," and give up an opening to expand in Southeast Asia. '","'They come after the company told analysts this month that restructuring GM’s international operations outside of China to produce profit margins in the mid-single digits would represent “a $2 billion improvement” on two years ago. '","'GM has forecast a flat profit for 2020 after a difficult 2019"," and is facing ballooning interest in electric car rival Tesla Inc ('","'). '","'GM is “focusing on markets where we have the right strategies to drive robust returns"," and prioritizing global investments that will drive growth in the future of mobility","” especially in electric and autonomous vehicles"," GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement late on Sunday. '","'The latest changes - a continuation of GM’s retreat from Asia that began in 2015 when it announced it would stop making GM-branded cars in Indonesia - will lead to cash and non-cash charges of $1.1 billion.

'","'Barra has prioritized profit margins over sales volume and global presence since taking over in 2014.  '","'In 2017"," she sold GM’s European Opel and Vauxhall businesses to Peugeot SA ('","') and exited South Africa and other African markets. Since then"," Barra has decided to pull GM out of Vietnam"," Indonesia and India.  '","'Like Britain"," Australia and New Zealand are right-hand drive markets. With sales of GM’s Australian Holden brand plummeting"," the company could not justify the investment to continue building right-hand drive vehicles"," GM President Mark Reuss said. '","'The move stoked anger in Australia"," where GM Holden long ranked among the country’s best selling car companies after the first locally made mass-production car rolled off the assembly line with a Holden badge in 1948. '","'Amid continuous decline in new car sales"," GM said it was ending Australian factory production in 2017 and last year called time on former best-seller the Commodore as part of a shift towards more compact SUVs and utility vehicles. '","'Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday he was disappointed and angry at the decision"," although not surprised. '","'“Australian taxpayers put billions into this multinational company. They let the brand just wither away on their watch","” he told reporters in Melbourne.   '","'Great Wall"," one of China’s biggest sport-utility vehicle makers"," said it will sell cars from the Thai manufacturing base"," which also has an engine plant"," in Southeast Asia and Australia as it seeks global sales amid a slowing domestic market. '","'“There is no choice"," if we don’t go global"," we will not survive","” Wei Jianjun"," chairman of the Baoding-based automaker"," said last year when Great Wall opened a plant in Russia.   '","'It also signed an agreement in January to buy GM’s car plant in India. The Thai transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

'","'They come after the company told analysts this month that restructuring GM’s international operations outside of China to produce profit margins in the mid-single digits would represent “a $2 billion improvement” on two years ago. '","'GM has forecast a flat profit for 2020 after a difficult 2019"," and is facing ballooning interest in electric car rival Tesla Inc ('","'). '","'GM is “focusing on markets where we have the right strategies to drive robust returns"," and prioritizing global investments that will drive growth in the future of mobility","” especially in electric and autonomous vehicles"," GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement late on Sunday. '","'The latest changes - a continuation of GM’s retreat from Asia that began in 2015 when it announced it would stop making GM-branded cars in Indonesia - will lead to cash and non-cash charges of $1.1 billion.

'","'Barra has prioritized profit margins over sales volume and global presence since taking over in 2014.

Since then"," Barra has decided to pull GM out of Vietnam"," Indonesia and India.  '","'Like Britain"," Australia and New Zealand are right-hand drive markets. With sales of GM’s Australian Holden brand plummeting"," the company could not justify the investment to continue building right-hand drive vehicles"," GM President Mark Reuss said. '","'The move stoked anger in Australia"," where GM Holden long ranked among the country’s best selling car companies after the first locally made mass-production car rolled off the assembly line with a Holden badge in 1948. '","'Amid continuous decline in new car sales"," GM said it was ending Australian factory production in 2017 and last year called time on former best-seller the Commodore as part of a shift towards more compact SUVs and utility vehicles. '","'Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday he was disappointed and angry at the decision"," although not surprised. '","'“Australian taxpayers put billions into this multinational company. They let the brand just wither away on their watch","” he told reporters in Melbourne.   '","'Great Wall"," one of China’s biggest sport-utility vehicle makers"," said it will sell cars from the Thai manufacturing base"," which also has an engine plant"," in Southeast Asia and Australia as it seeks global sales amid a slowing domestic market. '","'“There is no choice"," if we don’t go global"," we will not survive","” Wei Jianjun"," chairman of the Baoding-based automaker"," said last year when Great Wall opened a plant in Russia.   '","'It also signed an agreement in January to buy GM’s car plant in India. The Thai transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.

move to control artisanal cobalt is double-edged: Andy Home","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'7 Min Read'","'(Repeats column published on Friday) '","'* Global mined cobalt production: '","' '","'* Cobalt Price: '","' '","'By Andy Home '","'LONDON"," Feb 7 (Reuters) - The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has announced ambitious plans to take control of the country’s wild-west artisanal cobalt sector. '","'A new state company"," Entreprise Generale du Cobalt (EGC)"," has been given monopoly powers to purchase and market cobalt from the informal sector. '","'The move is being hailed by the government as a way to clean up a sector that is tarnished with a reputation for child labour"," lax safety and illegal activity. '","'That would be very good news for the cobalt market. '","'The human cost of mining in the Congo"," which accounts for more than 60% of global cobalt production"," is one of the reasons companies such as Tesla are actively trying to engineer the metal out of their battery supply chain. '","'Congo’s humanitarian goals however go hand-in-hand with financial motives"," firstly to boost tax revenues and secondly to exert more control over the cobalt price. '","'That may be less good news for the cobalt market. '","'“We are going to eliminate child labour"," we are going to eliminate labour by pregnant women and we are going to eliminate fraud in this sector so that the cobalt (...) will be responsible cobalt","” according to Albert Yuma"," chairman of state mining company Gecamines"," which will oversee the EGC. '","'The idea is the new company will act as monopoly buyer of cobalt from the cooperatives that pool the output of artisanal miners. '","'At the moment much of this “grey” production stream is bought by middle-men"," mostly Chinese"," who then sell the cobalt ore on to first-stage processors"," also mostly Chinese. '","'Artisanal product becomes mixed with official-sector product"," causing traceability problems for end-users desperate to avoid being tainted by allegations of using a metal generated by child or “slave” labour. '","'The EGC will use its purchasing power to extend official oversight on working conditions in the artisanal sector"," using non-government organisations to select cooperatives based on their compliance with responsible sourcing criteria '","'Those that don’t qualify will be “sanctioned”"," according to Yuma. That may be a euphemism for being closed. '","'Such state intervention is a welcome development for the cobalt market. '","'The problems associated with artisanal cobalt mining in the Congo are generating an aggressive industry response with consumers trying to eliminate or at least drastically reduce the metal’s usage in lithium-ion batteries. '","'That in turn acts as a major hindrance to building out a sustainable and responsible cobalt supply chain. '","'Why invest in a new mine to produce a metal that even its users don’t want to use? '","'The government decree establishing the new state cobalt company also references “the necessity of controlling the entire artisanal supply chain and boosting government revenues through control of prices”. '","'At one level this makes sense. '","'Artisanal production and the grey-market supply chain it feeds are currently beyond the reach of the state. '","'Integrating artisanal production into the official sector should boost the government’s mineral take and put more money in the pockets of the miners"," who receive a fraction of the cobalt price. '","'However"," how far does Congo want to go in terms of “control of prices”? '","'The country’s informal sector is a powerful market actor"," playing the role of global “swing producer”. '","'During periods of low pricing"," such as that seen in the early part of the last decade"," artisanal production falls as miners switch to more lucrative metals such as gold. '","'When the price explodes"," such as during the boom years of 2017 and 2018"," artisanal production steps up as miners return to cobalt sites. '","'Quantifying how much the informal sector produces is inevitably a tricky exercise. '","'Research house CRU has estimated that artisanal production surged from around 6","000 tonnes in 2016 to over 19","000 tonnes in 2017 as the cobalt price started booming. (“Artisanal mining will balance the cobalt market","” Oct 1"," 2018). '","'It almost certainly increased again in 2018 as the price peaked close to $100","000 per tonne. '","'This surge of swing capacity then contributed to the market’s collapse back down to $30","000 last year"," by which stage it’s a fair guess that many artisanal miners were squeezed out. '","'If the new EGC is successful in its attempt to take control of artisanal production"," which is still a big “if”"," it will assume the mantle of global swing producer. '","'The company is planning to talk with financiers and is open to the idea of partnering with a private-sector player to ensure sufficient funds for its operations. '","'That suggests a level of ambition that goes beyond a clean-up of the domestic artisanal sector to an exertion of pricing power on the international market. '","'Congo"," like its minerals-rich neighbour Zambia"," is desperate to boost revenues from its mining sector. It has already aggressively hiked royalties on “strategic” metals such as cobalt. '","'Taking physical control over the artisanal supply chain would"," from a government perspective"," be another mechanism for ensuring a fair return for the extraction of Congo’s mineral riches. '","'In theory"," the new monopoly could smooth out periodic air-pockets in the supply chain by timing the release of its cobalt. '","'In practice"," the temptation to use its market power to support prices during periods of low-growth demand may prove irresistible. '","'History is littered with examples as to how such well-intentioned ambitions can come very badly undone. '","'The Tin Crisis of 1985-1986 looms largest of all in the industrial metal markets. '","'Successive multinational tin agreements"," backed both by producer and consumer countries"," tried to control the tin price within a mutually acceptable price band. '","'Things went well during the good years of strong tin demand and pricing but turned nasty when market conditions changed. '","'The buffer stock manager"," charged with managing tin supply to the marketplace"," ran out of money. '","'The tin price collapsed"," causing a spate of mine closures"," and the lawsuits flew. It took years for the market fully to recover. '","'Tin should serve as a warning to the Congo government to use its cobalt monopoly wisely. '","'The cobalt supply chain will welcome a concerted attempt to integrate artisanal mining into the formal sector.

black swan to bubble: investors weigh coronavirus risks","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'5 Min Read'","'NEW YORK (Reuters) - When worries over the coronavirus shook U.S. stocks out of a period of quiet trading last week"," investors wondered if the outbreak was the “Black Swan” event that would trigger a sharp decline. Less than a week later"," talk has turned instead to a market melt-up. '","'After that brief swoon"," the market made a roaring recovery"," and there were also rallies in Tesla Inc"," bitcoin and other assets often seen as barometers for risk appetite. '","'The sharp snapback has revived concerns among some investors that market participants are growing overly confident that easy money policies from central banks will underpin prices"," despite serious risks to global growth from the coronavirus. '","'As of Friday"," it remained unclear how deadly and contagious the virus is. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China"," in Hong Kong and the Philippines"," prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. '","'There were 41 new cases among about 3","700 people quarantined in a cruise ship moored off Japan"," taking the total on board to 61. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3","600 on board.  '","'“There could be more downside if the (outbreak) spreads"," but for now the trend is still up. The bigger risk is arguably that we end up in a mini-bubble","” said Troy Gayeski - Co-CIO of SkyBridge"," an alternative investments firm. '","'Gayeski said that coming into the year SkyBridge had positioned its portfolio to take advantage of gains by using equity call options. '","'“We did put some equity call exposure in the portfolio coming into the year"," because if one of the risks is a bubble developing then why not try to participate?” '","'The S&P 500 stands near a record high after rallying nearly 4% from its lows of last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite have also hit highs while the CBOE Volatility Index"," a gauge of investor anxiety"," has drifted lower after spiking last week to its highest in nearly four months.  '","'Michael O’Rourke"," chief market strategist at brokerage firm JonesTrading"," noted markets have shot higher despite uncertainty over how long travel restrictions and shutdowns will weigh on large portions of China’s economy. Easy monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve has made investors bolder about taking risks"," he said.  '","'“Every time there’s been a downturn in the market"," the Fed has stepped in to ease","” he said. “Investors have been trained in a Pavlovian manner to not assess risk and buy every dip you get.” '","'The World Health Organization said Wednesday was the first day the overall number of new coronavirus cases in China dropped"," although the outbreak continues to rage in Hubei province.  '","'It’s still unclear"," however"," how long the shutdowns that have paralyzed Hubei and other areas will remain in place"," or the effects they will have on growth in China and abroad.  '","'“My client conversations are all about"," ‘is this the black swan? Is this what can derail the global expansion?” said Torsten Slok"," chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. A “black swan” event refers to an unforeseen occurrence that typically has extreme consequences. '","'Right now"," “we don’t think this is a Black Swan.” '","'Investors will worry if China extends shutdowns or expands them to other areas"," said Jens Nordvig"," founder of analytics firm Exante Data.  '","'“Most people expect things will normalize by next week","” he said. “If there was an announcement of another extension...that will freak people out.” '","'Trying to time the market’s declines and betting against more gains has been a losing strategy over the more than decade-long bull run in stocks"," despite repeated worries about rich valuations and overexuberance.  '","'Still"," some investors are taking a cautious view of the recent advance. George Schultze"," founder of Schultze Asset Management in New York"," said now may be a good time to lock in gains on the rally.  '","'“For investors that have had big gains and are mostly in passive ETF strategies"," now may be a good time to put some cash on the side and realize some gains","” said Schultze.

'","'The Fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market"," pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze.  '","'Policy-makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle.

move to control artisanal cobalt is double-edged: Andy Home","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'7 Min Read'","'(The opinions expressed here are those of the author"," a columnist for Reuters.) '","'* Global mined cobalt production: '","' '","'* Cobalt Price: '","' '","'By Andy Home '","'LONDON"," Feb 7 (Reuters) - The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has announced ambitious plans to take control of the country’s wild-west artisanal cobalt sector. '","'A new state company"," Entreprise Generale du Cobalt (EGC)"," has been given monopoly powers to purchase and market cobalt from the informal sector. '","'The move is being hailed by the government as a way to clean up a sector that is tarnished with a reputation for child labour"," lax safety and illegal activity. '","'That would be very good news for the cobalt market. '","'The human cost of mining in the Congo"," which accounts for more than 60% of global cobalt production"," is one of the reasons companies such as Tesla are actively trying to engineer the metal out of their battery supply chain. '","'Congo’s humanitarian goals however go hand-in-hand with financial motives"," firstly to boost tax revenues and secondly to exert more control over the cobalt price. '","'That may be less good news for the cobalt market. '","'“We are going to eliminate child labour"," we are going to eliminate labour by pregnant women and we are going to eliminate fraud in this sector so that the cobalt (...) will be responsible cobalt","” according to Albert Yuma"," chairman of state mining company Gecamines"," which will oversee the EGC. '","'The idea is the new company will act as monopoly buyer of cobalt from the cooperatives that pool the output of artisanal miners. '","'At the moment much of this “grey” production stream is bought by middle-men"," mostly Chinese"," who then sell the cobalt ore on to first-stage processors"," also mostly Chinese. '","'Artisanal product becomes mixed with official-sector product"," causing traceability problems for end-users desperate to avoid being tainted by allegations of using a metal generated by child or “slave” labour. '","'The EGC will use its purchasing power to extend official oversight on working conditions in the artisanal sector"," using non-government organisations to select cooperatives based on their compliance with responsible sourcing criteria '","'Those that don’t qualify will be “sanctioned”"," according to Yuma. That may be a euphemism for being closed. '","'Such state intervention is a welcome development for the cobalt market. '","'The problems associated with artisanal cobalt mining in the Congo are generating an aggressive industry response with consumers trying to eliminate or at least drastically reduce the metal’s usage in lithium-ion batteries. '","'That in turn acts as a major hindrance to building out a sustainable and responsible cobalt supply chain. '","'Why invest in a new mine to produce a metal that even its users don’t want to use? '","'The government decree establishing the new state cobalt company also references “the necessity of controlling the entire artisanal supply chain and boosting government revenues through control of prices”. '","'At one level this makes sense. '","'Artisanal production and the grey-market supply chain it feeds are currently beyond the reach of the state. '","'Integrating artisanal production into the official sector should boost the government’s mineral take and put more money in the pockets of the miners"," who receive a fraction of the cobalt price. '","'However"," how far does Congo want to go in terms of “control of prices”? '","'The country’s informal sector is a powerful market actor"," playing the role of global “swing producer”. '","'During periods of low pricing"," such as that seen in the early part of the last decade"," artisanal production falls as miners switch to more lucrative metals such as gold. '","'When the price explodes"," such as during the boom years of 2017 and 2018"," artisanal production steps up as miners return to cobalt sites. '","'Quantifying how much the informal sector produces is inevitably a tricky exercise. '","'Research house CRU has estimated that artisanal production surged from around 6","000 tonnes in 2016 to over 19","000 tonnes in 2017 as the cobalt price started booming. (“Artisanal mining will balance the cobalt market","” Oct 1"," 2018). '","'It almost certainly increased again in 2018 as the price peaked close to $100","000 per tonne. '","'This surge of swing capacity then contributed to the market’s collapse back down to $30","000 last year"," by which stage it’s a fair guess that many artisanal miners were squeezed out. '","'If the new EGC is successful in its attempt to take control of artisanal production"," which is still a big “if”"," it will assume the mantle of global swing producer. '","'The company is planning to talk with financiers and is open to the idea of partnering with a private-sector player to ensure sufficient funds for its operations. '","'That suggests a level of ambition that goes beyond a clean-up of the domestic artisanal sector to an exertion of pricing power on the international market. '","'Congo"," like its minerals-rich neighbour Zambia"," is desperate to boost revenues from its mining sector. It has already aggressively hiked royalties on “strategic” metals such as cobalt. '","'Taking physical control over the artisanal supply chain would"," from a government perspective"," be another mechanism for ensuring a fair return for the extraction of Congo’s mineral riches. '","'In theory"," the new monopoly could smooth out periodic air-pockets in the supply chain by timing the release of its cobalt. '","'In practice"," the temptation to use its market power to support prices during periods of low-growth demand may prove irresistible. '","'History is littered with examples as to how such well-intentioned ambitions can come very badly undone. '","'The Tin Crisis of 1985-1986 looms largest of all in the industrial metal markets. '","'Successive multinational tin agreements"," backed both by producer and consumer countries"," tried to control the tin price within a mutually acceptable price band. '","'Things went well during the good years of strong tin demand and pricing but turned nasty when market conditions changed. '","'The buffer stock manager"," charged with managing tin supply to the marketplace"," ran out of money. '","'The tin price collapsed"," causing a spate of mine closures"," and the lawsuits flew. It took years for the market fully to recover. '","'Tin should serve as a warning to the Congo government to use its cobalt monopoly wisely. '","'The cobalt supply chain will welcome a concerted attempt to integrate artisanal mining into the formal sector. It may not be so receptive to such a powerful production driver being used to distort market pricing.

Musk’s liability for Tesla’s SolarCity deal could come down to a question of his control","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'9 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - Does Elon Musk"," who owns just 22.1% of Tesla’s shares"," control the company he founded and continues to lead? If so"," according to a summary judgment '","' issued Tuesday by Vice-Chancellor'","' of Delaware Chancery Court"," Delaware law presumes that he wielded coercive influence over Tesla shareholders who voted to approve the company’s $2.6 billion acquisition of the Musk startup SolarCity in 2016. '","'Tesla shareholders"," represented by '","'"," '","' and '","'"," contend that Musk pushed Tesla to rescue SolarCity from insolvency"," breaching his fiduciary duty and wasting Tesla assets. Tesla directors"," including Musk"," have argued throughout the long-running litigation that the SolarCity acquisition process was unconflicted and that the deal was approved by shareholders in a fully informed"," non-coerced vote. (All of the directors except for Musk '","' to a $60 million"," insurance-funded settlement of shareholders’ claims.) Vice-Chancellor Slights is scheduled to oversee a 10-day trial of shareholders’ claims next month. '","'  '","'The key to the case is the standard of review that the Chancery judge will apply to shareholders’ claims. Shareholders have a vastly better chance of tagging Musk with liability if they can persuade the vice-chancellor to evaluate the deal’s entire fairness"," rather than deferring to the board’s business judgment – a standard that pretty much dooms shareholders’ M&A claims. '","'Musk’s alleged control of Tesla is"," in turn"," the critical factor in determining which standard should apply. When there’s no controlling shareholder"," Delaware law gives wide latitude to boards’ decisionmaking. Under the state Supreme Court’s 2016 decision in '","'"," directors of companies that have no controlling shareholder are entitled to business judgment deference even if the sales process was flawed"," as long as the deal ended up being approved by a majority of shareholders. But Corwin doesn’t shield directors of companies that are under the sway of a controlling shareholder. To protect minority shareholders from the controller’s potentially conflicting interests"," those deals are subject to judicial review of their entire fairness. '","'Vice-Chancellor Slights already '","'"," back in 2018"," that Tesla shareholders plausibly alleged Musk’s control in their complaint. The judge '","' at the pleading stage"," concluding that shareholders’ allegations about Musk’s voting interest"," outsized influence at the company and domination of the SolarCity deal process added up to an inference that Musk wielded the power of a controlling shareholder. '","'But that 2018 decision only entitled shareholders to move ahead with discovery. Last summer"," the board’s lawyers at '","' and '","' told the judge that investors had failed to establish in discovery that they’re entitled to entire fairness review. In a '","' judgment"," the board’s lawyers argued (among other things) that the case record showed no evidence that Musk somehow coerced independent shareholders to approve the SolarCity acquisition. So"," according to the board’s brief"," the business judgment standard must apply to a deal that was conditioned upon – and subsequently approved in – an uncoerced"," fully-informed shareholder vote. '","'“There is nothing in the record that could support a finding that the sophisticated institutional investors here were willing to risk breaching their own fiduciary duties to their clients out of fear of some alleged ‘potent retributive capacity’ on the part of Musk","” the board’s brief said. '","'Shareholders argued in their '","' brief that Vice-Chancellor Slights must apply the entire fairness standard regardless of Musk’s control because the board was hopelessly conflicted and shareholders were duped into backing an acquisition that was misrepresented in Tesla’s proxy disclosures. '","'In Tuesday’s decision"," the vice-chancellor mostly denied both sides’ requests for summary judgment"," concluding that he needs to delve more deeply into the facts to decide which standard of evaluation to use. '","'Importantly"," though"," he held that shareholders don’t have to come up with specific evidence that Musk coerced independent shareholders to approve the SolarCity deal. Delaware law"," he said"," presumes that controlling shareholders have “inherently coercive” power over their fellow investors. '","'“A conflicted controller has strong incentives to engage in transactions that benefit him to the detriment of the corporation and its other stockholders","” Vice-Chancellor Slights wrote. “And"," as an 800-pound gorilla in the board room and at the ballot box"," the controller has retributive capacities that lead our courts to question whether independent directors or voting shareholders can freely exercise their judgment in approving transactions sponsored by the controller. In these circumstances"," shareholders are entitled to an independent review where the controller is made to explain why the transaction’s process and price were fair.” '","'Defense lawyers had argued that Delaware precedent on controlling shareholders’ inherently coercive power only addresses pleading-stage litigation. Once a case moves past discovery"," they argued"," shareholders have to provide proof that the controlling shareholder swayed the vote. Otherwise"," their brief said"," the shareholder vote should be treated as uncoerced – and the deal should be reviewed under the business judgment standard. '","'Vice-Chancellor Slights hailed that “ingenious” argument – but rejected it. Delaware courts developed their precedent on the coercive power of controlling shareholders because they understand how the world works"," he said: The ability to control is self-fulfilling. And though the vice-chancellor conceded that even some of the Delaware jurists who originated the theory have subsequently questioned it in a law review article"," the presumption that a controlling shareholder has inherently coercive power remains good law. '","'Of course"," Slights said"," to invoke the entire fairness standard of review"," investors must still show that Musk was"," in fact"," a controlling shareholder by dint of his outsized influence at the company. And even if shareholders clear that hurdle"," Musk can still prove at trial that the SolarCity deal was fair"," which is exactly what defense lawyers have been arguing since the case began.

'","'To date"," more than 17","000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been documented worldwide"," with the majority of the cases clustered in Hubei province"," China. To try to curb infection rates"," the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures"," including travel restrictions and quarantine measures"," to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions. '","'Developments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility"," succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play.  '","'In mainland China"," the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2"," to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices"," such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday"," are legal. '","'Enterprise Singapore"," a government agency"," has issued a guide{'","'} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers"," including communications"," human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times. '","'In practice"," segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees"," even outside working hours. For example"," the South China Morning Post"," an English language newspaper in Hong Kong"," established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months. '","'Many companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases"," partially due to containment measures from the local government"," lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region’s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas. '","'In comparison"," there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea"," Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel. '","'In Canada"," some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill"," or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations"," especially smaller firms"," may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus. '","'Internationally"," businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{'","'}"," where manufacturing and logistics activity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however"," many other commodities"," goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M"," Japan Airlines"," Baidu Inc"," McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses.  '","'BCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult"," requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing"," challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor. '","'Some important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace"," even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times"," such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough. '","'Businesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time"," alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers"," conferencing lines and other necessities. '","'Moreover"," managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness.  '","'Planning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however"," it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control"," or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result"," businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat.

'","'ChargePoint"," which operates but does not own its charging network"," and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO) told Reuters they formed the National Highway Charging Collaborative"," with plans to install Level 2 and DC fast chargers at more than 4","000 U.S. locations by 2030 to expand EV charging along highways and in rural communities.  '","'The money will be raised through private operators"," state and local governments"," private infrastructure funds and others"," ChargePoint Chief Executive Pasquale Romano said. '","'“Enabling long distance electric travel and equipping rural areas with vital universal charging is key and must begin scaling aggressively today","” he said in an interview. “This collaboration will play an important role in paving the way to the mass adoption of EVs.” '","'There are only a few million EVs on U.S. roads today"," but in May 2019 the International Energy Agency forecast that figure could reach over 130 million by 2030. '","'“It appears clear that the next generation of fuel is going to be electricity"," so we want to make sure that our members are prepared to meet the needs of their customers","” NATSO CEO Lisa Mullings said in a separate interview. '","'ChargePoint operates more than 108","000 charging points globally"," mostly in North America"," and aims to increase that to 2.5 million by 2025. ChargePoint estimates it has a 70% share of the market for commercial charging in the United States. '","'In June 2019"," ChargePoint signed a deal with VW subsidiary Electrify America to make the United States’ two largest EV charging networks accessible to customers of both companies. '","'ChargePoint"," founded in 2007"," has raised $538 million from investors including Daimler"," BMW and Siemens in Germany"," as well as U.S. energy firms Chevron and America Electric Power.

Tesla stock envy, GM hopes to sell investors on its EV, tech future","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'5 Min Read'","'DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co ('","') has watched with frustration and envy as the market value of electric carmaker Tesla Inc ('","') has ballooned to about two and a half times GM’s size"," but on Wednesday the Detroit automaker made the case that its EV and self-driving technology strategy deserves a higher value. '","'GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and top executives hosted an investor conference in New York to convince potential shareholders GM is a burgeoning technology firm at the forefront of tomorrow’s electric and self-driving cars.  '","'“We believe we’re a compelling investment opportunity","” GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters after GM reported quarterly results"," when asked about the run-up in Tesla’s stock. '","'“From a share-price standpoint"," we’re very bullish on the future","” she added. '","'Barra has been restructuring GM’s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of “zero emissions and zero accidents” for several years.  '","'Still"," GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion"," below Tesla’s valuation of about $130 billion.  '","'“The market’s got it wrong","” said Chris Susanin"," co-portfolio manager with Levin Easterly Partners"," which owns shares in GM but not Tesla. “GM should be the $150 billion market cap"," not Tesla.”  '","'The bulk of GM’s profits is still derived from the fuel-hungry pickup trucks and SUVs sold in the United States. The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year"," but that is threatened by a market slowdown"," rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. '","'While China will deliver lower equity income to GM in the near term"," it remains a solid contributor that is profitable and dividend paying"," and will play a key role in the development of EVs globally"," officials said. GM also sees growth for its Cadillac brand in China. '","'Barra’s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future. '","'While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s"," GM has said it will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years. '","'GM laid out a more detailed plan for the development of EVs and self-driving vehicles at the investor day"," including its Cruise self-driving unit.  '","'Some analysts have suggested GM should spin off Cruise"," but Suryadevara said GM has no plans to do that. She added that spending in 2020 on that business will roughly match last year’s $800 million. '","'Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the self-driving market opportunity totals $8 trillion.  '","'One of the audiences for the investor day is potential employees as GM competes with Tesla and other automakers globally to hire top engineers and software developers outside of Detroit"," highlighting technical centers in Ontario and Israel. '","'Barra"," asked whether Tesla’s eventual electric pickup offering could squeeze GM’s margins"," said her company understands that business. “I think we can have our cake and eat it too","” she said. '","'GM also said it will offer its Supercruise partially automated driving system on 22 models by the end of 2023"," GM President Mark Reuss said.  '","'GM also laid out its plan to reduce manufacturing complexity this year by eliminating 25% of the parts used in its plants. Barra also said GM targets sourcing all of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2040"," a decade sooner than previously promised.  '","'In December"," GM and South Korea’s LG Chem ('","') said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio"," creating one of the world’s largest battery facilities. '","'That same month"," GM’s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030. '","'GM said last week it would invest $2.2 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build electric trucks and SUVs.

'","'China said another 65 people had died in the previous 24 hours"," in the highest daily total yet"," taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490"," most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan"," where the new virus emerged late last year. '","'There have been two deaths outside mainland China - in the Philippines and Hong Kong - both following visits to Wuhan. '","'The virus had disrupted air travel"," with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries"," including the United States"," banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks. '","'Hong Kong said all visitors from mainland China would be quarantined for two weeks"," while Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday. '","'The disruption spread to cruise ships this week"," with about 3","700 people facing at least two weeks cut off aboard a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed 10 passengers had tested positive for the virus. '","'Passengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck. '","'“This is not a good situation","” British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook. '","'In Hong Kong"," 3","600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier. '","'Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways ('","') asked its 27","000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave"," saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis. '","'American Airlines Group ('","') and United Airlines ('","') said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week"," a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.

'","'Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut"," cities cut off and travel links constricted"," fuelling worries about global supply chains.     Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday.

'","'German sportswear company Adidas ('","') said it was temporarily shutting a “considerable” number of its stores in China. '","'White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month. '","'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the virus was adding to economic doubts.

'","'Shares in the No. 2 U.S. automaker plunged 9.4% in after-hours trading"," shaving more than $3 billion off the company’s value.

'","'“The results were not OK in 2019","” Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told reporters at the company’s headquarters outside Detroit. '","'“As I look to 2020 and beyond"," I’m very optimistic","” he said"," while cautioning that Ford’s lower guidance does not yet account for the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. '","'In an after-hours call with financial analysts"," Chief Executive Jim Hackett was more blunt about the challenge of balancing Ford’s protracted turnaround efforts with its continuing work on future technology"," including electric and self-driving cars. '","'“I don’t think this company can keep straddling the old and new worlds forever ... This company has to change","” Hackett said. '","'Ford said it expects 2020 operating earnings to be in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.26 a share. '","'Stone said Ford expects to continue its quarterly dividend of 15 cents"," which could cost the company $2.4 billion in 2020. Asked about continuing the dividend after lowering its 2020 guidance"," Hackett said"," “We like to return value to shareholders.” '","'The disappointing 2020 forecast"," coming after Ford previously trimmed its 2019 outlook"," is a blow for Hackett"," who took the helm in May 2017. '","'He has been asking investors to be patient with a restructuring that has seen the formation of a wide-ranging alliance on commercial"," electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG ('","') and the sale of its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India’s Mahindra & Mahindra.    '","'But by Ford’s own accounting"," the restructuring is far from complete.

'","'For the fourth quarter of 2019"," Ford reported a net loss of $1.7 billion"," or 42 cents a share"," compared with a loss of $100 million"," or 3 cents a share"," a year earlier. '","'The quarter included a loss of $2.2 billion due to higher contributions to its employee pension plans"," something it disclosed last month.     '","'Revenue in the quarter fell 5% to $39.7 billion"," above the $36.5 billion Wall Street had expected. '","'Ford’s adjusted free cash flow fell 67% in the fourth quarter to $500 million"," including the $600 million cost of  bonuses related to a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW deal also played a role in driving North American automotive profit margins down to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.     '","'Ford said its operating losses in China last year totaled $771 million"," including a loss of $207 million in the fourth quarter. It lost $1.5 billion in 2018.

'","'In December"," Ford said it would halve its operating loss in 2019 and nearly halve it again in 2020"," followed by further improvement in 2021. '","'However"," that forecast was before the appearance of the  fast-spreading coronavirus and its crippling effects on China’s economy. '","'Ford’s China sales fell about 15% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.

Tesla stake worth $30 billion after electrifying stock surge","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'5 Min Read'","'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla is making Elon Musk a lot richer without paying him a dime. '","'A blistering stock rally has bolstered the value of CEO Musk’s 19% stake in the electric car maker by $16 billion since the start of 2020"," to $30 billion.  '","'Tuesday’s steep climb in the share price could sweeten Musk’s payday under his record-breaking compensation package"," which is built on stock options that rely on market value targets. Two milestones have now been achieved that could see Musk unlock options worth $1.8 billion. '","'The controversial chief executive"," who is also the majority owner and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX"," recently testified that he did not have a lot of cash as he successfully defended himself in a defamation lawsuit. He previously has taken loans using his Tesla shares as collateral.  '","'Musk does not take a salary"," choosing instead a risky options package that envisions the stock market value of Tesla rising to $650 billion over 10 years"," a prospect that was derided by some investors when the deal was announced in 2018.  '","'That target now looks less crazy. Shares of Tesla have rallied over 50% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit last Wednesday"," which was viewed as a major accomplishment for a company competing against established automotive heavyweights including General Motors Co and BMW. '","'Tesla shares have climbed about 400% since early June"," helped by the company’s better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai. '","'On Tuesday"," Tesla surged as much as 24% before falling back in the final minutes of the trading session to end the day up 13.7%. That put its market capitalization at $160 billion"," almost twice the combined value of Ford Motor and General Motors.  '","'The shares had also rallied on Monday"," partly fueled by Panasonic Corp’s saying its automotive battery venture with Tesla was profitable for the first time. '","'The options Musk was awarded in 2018 vest incrementally based on targets for Tesla’s stock market value and its financial performance. The market capitalization would have to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement’s 10-year period"," with the full package payout reached if the market cap reaches $650 billion"," as well as the company’s meeting revenue and profit targets.  '","'Musk is on his way to seeing his first two tranches of options vest. He achieved operational targets on revenue and adjusted earnings last year.   '","'The rise in Tesla’s market capitalization last month to a target of $100 billion opened the way for Musk’s first tranche of options to vest. With Tuesday’s surging share price"," the market capitalization blew past the second target of $150 billion"," opening the way for the second tranche to vest. Tesla’s market capitalization must stay at or above each target level for one- and six-month averages for each set of options to vest. '","'Tesla was valued at about $52 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in March 2018"," a time when the company faced a cash crunch"," production delays and increasing competition from rivals.  '","'A full payoff for Musk would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives"," according to Institutional Shareholder Services"," a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time. '","'Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares"," and his  compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all his options tranches vest. '","'When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package"," it said he could in theory reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However"," Tesla has since awarded stock to employees and last year sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds"," diluting the value of the stock. '","'Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles"," with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen. '","'Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit"," cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla “sell” than “buy","” and the company’s stock is the most shorted on Wall Street.

2035"," five years earlier than planned"," in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. '","'The step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers"," as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. '","'Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom’s environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. '","'“We have to deal with our CO2 emissions","” Johnson said at a launch event for COP26 at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday. “As a country and as a society"," as a planet"," as a species"," we must now act.” '","'The government said that"," subject to consultation"," it would end the sale of new petrol"," diesel and hybrid cars and vans in 2035"," or earlier if a faster transition was possible. '","'Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen ('","') emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules.  '","'The mayors of Paris"," Madrid"," Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. '","'While demand for electric vehicles has surged in Britain"," Europe’s second-largest market for new vehicles"," diesel and petrol models still account for 90% of sales. Prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points"," the range of certain models and the cost. '","'The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds ($3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1","000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets. '","'While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine"," others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail. '","'Ford ('","')"," Volkswagen and Vauxhall are Britain’s biggest-selling car manufacturers"," according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Tesla ('","')"," Mitsubishi ('","') and BMW ('","') produce the top three selling electric cars in Britain. '","'Although the ban will not come into force for another 15 years"," the change will affect decision-making sooner as carmakers decide on investments long before a vehicle first rolls off a production line with a model life cycle lasting around seven years. '","'The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest export market for its car manufacturers"," amounting to about 20% of global sales"," and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants.  '","'The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. '","'Johnson also signalled that a phase-out of Britain’s coal-fired power plants would be brought forward by a year to 2024. Coal provides just 3% of the country’s electricity"," down from 70% three decades ago"," he said. '","'Johnson’s launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit’s former head Clare O’Neill who was sacked from the post last week. '","'Johnson declined to answer any questions on O’Neill"," but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister with her replacement expected to be announced this month.

dream: Britain to ban new petrol and hybrid cars from 2035","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'4 Min Read'","'LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ban the sale of new petrol"," diesel and hybrid cars from 2035"," five years earlier than planned"," in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. '","'The step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers"," as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. '","'Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom’s environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. '","'“We have to deal with our CO2 emissions","” Johnson said at a launch event for COP26 at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday. “As a country and as a society"," as a planet"," as a species"," we must now act.” '","'The government said that"," subject to consultation"," it would end the sale of new petrol"," diesel and hybrid cars and vans in 2035"," or earlier if a faster transition was possible. '","'Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen ('","') emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules.  '","'The mayors of Paris"," Madrid"," Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. '","'While demand for electric vehicles has surged in Britain"," Europe’s second-largest market for new vehicles"," diesel and petrol models still account for 90% of sales. Prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points"," the range of certain models and the cost. '","'The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds ($3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1","000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets. '","'While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine"," others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail. '","'Ford ('","')"," Volkswagen and Vauxhall are Britain’s biggest-selling car manufacturers"," according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Tesla ('","')"," Mitsubishi ('","') and BMW ('","') produce the top three selling electric cars in Britain. '","'Although the ban will not come into force for another 15 years"," the change will affect decision-making sooner as carmakers decide on investments long before a vehicle first rolls off a production line with a model life cycle lasting around seven years. '","'The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest export market for its car manufacturers"," amounting to about 20% of global sales"," and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants.  '","'The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. '","'Johnson also signalled that a phase-out of Britain’s coal-fired power plants would be brought forward by a year to 2024. Coal provides just 3% of the country’s electricity"," down from 70% three decades ago"," he said. '","'Johnson’s launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit’s former head Clare O’Neill who was sacked from the post last week. '","'Johnson declined to answer any questions on O’Neill"," but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister with her replacement expected to be announced this month.

'","'Showroom traffic is expected to be sparse when extended Lunar New Year holidays end as much of the population is steering clear of public spaces"," while output is set to plunge in the short-term. '","'That is particularly true of Hubei province"," the center of the outbreak and a major car manufacturing hub that accounts for nearly 9% of China’s vehicle production. Dongfeng Motor Group ('","') and its partners Honda Motor ('","')"," Renault ('","') and PSA ('","') all have factories there. '","'“We expect (China) vehicle production to decline 3% for the full year"," with production down 15% in the first quarter"," including the extended new year shutdown","” Joseph Massaro"," CFO for auto technology supplier Aptiv ('","')"," told an earnings conference call. '","'But he said delayed production could be made up in the second quarter. “We don’t view this as a full year issue at the moment.”  '","'Seeking to rein in the epidemic"," which has killed more than 200 people"," authorities have extended Lunar New Year holidays by three days to Feb. 2 although many areas and companies are telling workers not to come back before Feb. 10.  '","'Prior to the outbreak"," forecasts for the world’s largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy"," the U.S.-China trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules. '","'Cui Dongshu"," secretary general at the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA)"," said his prediction for 1% growth this year now seems “under some pressure”. '","'The holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering cars at the end of the month as is their usual practice"," virtually guaranteeing a decline in sales for January. '","'“Although sales volumes in the first three weeks of January were okay"," there was no ‘sales sprint’ at the end of the month. So it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop","” Cui said in a blog post. '","'The big unknown is"," however"," just how far the outbreak"," which authorities expect to peak in February"," will ravage Chinese consumer spending. '","'Industry officials and analysts believe sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year. '","'The outbreak could even spur more Chinese consumers to embark on car ownership"," given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended"," said Yale Zhang"," head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. '","'“Customers who do not have their own car might realize they need one which might help sales this year","” he said.  '","'China has an estimated 170 vehicles per 1","000 people compared to 800 per 1","000 in the United States.  '","'CPCA’s Cui also noted the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic had little long-term impact on China’s passenger car market which grew 70% in 2003"," albeit from a low base and helped by economic stimulus. '","'Automakers with plants in Hubei"," particularly in its capital Wuhan"," where transport links have been cut to curb the virus"," will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans. Delays can often be made up later with extra shifts on weekends and at night. '","'Honda"," which has three assembly plants in Wuhan with Dongfeng"," said it was assessing how transport disruptions were affecting the supply of parts and that no decision had been made on when its factories will restart. Dongfeng"," Renault and PSA also said no decision had been made on when production might resume. '","'Other automakers with operations in Hubei include Nissan Motor Co ('","') which has a plant with Dongfeng and General Motors Co ('","') which has a venture with SAIC Motor Co ('","'). Nissan and GM did not respond to requests for comment. '","'Outside Hubei"," some automakers appeared more sanguine about their production schedules.  '","'Tesla Inc ('","')"," which started delivering cars built at its $2 billion car plant in Shanghai last month"," has said it expects a delay of just one to one-and-a-half weeks in its ramp up of China-built Model 3s due to the shutdown.      '","'In a sign"," however"," that the virus impact was not just limited to China"," Hyundai Motor ('","') said it is suspending some SUV output in South Korea this weekend as parts supplies had been disrupted.

'","'The $60 million settlement comes as a 10-day trial is scheduled to start on March 16 in Delaware in which shareholders seek $2.6 billion in damages"," the entire cost of the SolarCity deal. '","'A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. '","'Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties"," squandered Tesla’s assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money-losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor. '","'The settlement covered five current directors: Robyn Denholm"," Ira Ehrenpreis"," Antonio Gracias"," Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss"," who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal"," was also part of the settlement"," which was paid from insurance policies"," according to court documents.  '","'“Plaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk’s actions","” said Brian Quinn"," a professor at Boston College Law School. '","'The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware"," where Tesla is incorporated"," by an individual investor and five investment funds. '","'Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were “based on the claims of plaintiff’s lawyers looking for a payday"," and are not representative of our shareholders.” '","'The suit represents another legal headache for Musk"," who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer. '","'Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend  Musk’s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year. '","'At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity’s problems"," or their own conflicts. '","'SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins"," Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive"," who were the company’s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity’s  chairman and largest shareholder"," and five of Tesla’s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock. '","'Entering 2016"," SolarCity’s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.  '","'Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal"," which was approved by Tesla shareholders. '","'After the deal closed"," Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with Home Depot Inc. Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.  '","'Tesla has said Musk’s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed. '","'On Wednesday"," Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit"," sending its stock surging to an all-time high.

BID EUROPE-Can't shake the virus, or U.S. protectionism","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'6 Min Read'","'(A look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan. The views expressed are his own.) '","'By Mike Dolan '","'LONDON"," Jan 23 (Reuters) - The mood turned darker again on world markets on Thursday"," unable to shake off concerns over the Chinese virus scare"," hit by fresh U.S. tariff threats against Europe and anxious about some incoming corporate earnings reports. Data showing Japanese exports sliding more than forecast in December"," albeit before the U.S.-China trade truce kicked in"," added to the gloom. Anxiety over Italian politics added to the uncertainty while European markets await the outcome of the European Central Bank’s first policy meeting of the year later on Thursday. '","'The latest on China’s spreading coronavirus – although not wholly unexpected - was enough to hit regional Asian shares hard. Authorities locked down the 11-million-population city of Wuhan"," the reported source of the flu-like viral outbreak"," and shares of Chinese air and travel stocks were sent sliding. Shanghai’s equity benchmark lost almost 3% ahead of next week’s lunar new year break"," with Hong Kong down almost 2%. Brent crude oil fell to 6 week lows close to $62 as Goldman Sachs estimated the demand impact from containing the virus could knock about $3 per barrel off prices. China’s offshore yuan slid back to its weakest since Jan. 10 and Japan’s ‘safe haven’ yen firmed slightly. The Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency"," which would step up the international response. If it does so"," it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade. '","'But whatever the durable economic impact of the health scare"," the renewed trade belligerence from Washington toward Europe was arguably of greater concern as it cut across hopes for a period of global trade peace this year following the U.S.-China truce. U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin"," both attending this week’s annual Davos forum"," said Washington could raise auto tariffs against Europe in response to European plans levy taxes on giant U.S. digital and internet companies. While France claims it had agreed with Trump to postpone the issue for the remainder of the year"," the UK insisted it would go ahead with its digital tax plans in April – raising questions about a U.S. tariff response even as it held out the possibility of post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. '","'Weighed down by sliding autos"," European stocks clearly underperformed on Wednesday and were marked down again ahead of the open on Thursday. The ECB meeting will be watched closely later and although no change of policy stance is expected"," the central bank is expected to launch a review of its strategic policy framework much like the Federal Reserve has done over the past year. Euro/dollar was steady just under $1.11 going into the meeting and German bund futures ticked higher. Wall Street stocks notched up another record high on Wednesday"," but ended only fractionally in the black. While IBM results enlivened the technology sector and Tesla’s ongoing surge bringing a U.S. automaker’s market cap above $100 billion for the first time ever"," Netflix fell on disappointing subscriber numbers and Johnson & Johnson also lost 2% after its earnings update. Intel and Comcast top the slate later. U.S. stock futures are marginally in the red early on Thursday"," with U.S. Treasury yields at their lowest since Jan 8. Despite the trade threats from Washington"," sterling was the big currency market outperformer on Wednesday as Bank of England interest rate cut speculation receded following an upbeat UK employment and wage report earlier in the week and ahead of the first post-election business surveys out tomorrow. '","'On the European corporate news front"," auto stocks are likely to continue to crumble under pressure as Trump’s latest tariff threat adds onto to worries of falling sales and shrinking margins. Airlines"," hotels and luxury sectors are on our radar as tourism will take a hit due to virus scare in China"," just as millions were preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year. UK’s IHG says will allow customers to change or cancel stays scheduled up to Feb. 3 across mainland China"," Hong Kong"," Macau and Taiwan at no additional cost. On earnings"," there were some decent beats. European chip stocks are in focus after STMicro’s fourth quarter earnings beat. Traders see STMicro shares to open flat to 3% higher.  ASOS sales raced past estimates in latest evidence that online retailers have had a great Christmas at the cost of high street players. ASOS is seen rising 5% to 7% — a positive read across for Boohoo and Zalando. Germany’s Hochtief seen 5% down on 800 million euro on-time charge. Lufthansa was seen up 2% after a report of a potential listing of stake in its jet-maintenance unit. *  Europe corp events:  STMicro"," Novozymes"," Bankinter"," EQT"," Topdanmark; Sales updates from

'","'Late Friday"," NHTSA released a redacted version of the lengthy petition that said “Tesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads” and urged NHTSA “to recall all Model S"," Model X and Model 3 vehicles produced from 2013 to the present.” '","'The petition cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA. '","'Tesla did not immediately comment Friday. '","'Many of the complaints report sudden acceleration incidents when attempting to park vehicles in a garage or at a curb. Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes.

'","'In October"," the agency said it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2","000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years. '","'The 2","000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. A lawyer who filed the petition"," Edward Chen"," told Reuters in October that he strongly believes “this number is much larger than 2","000.” The review is ongoing. '","'Last week"," NHTSA said it was probing the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. '","'The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA’s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company’s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.

Volkswagen to buy 20% of Chinese battery maker Guoxuan amid electric push - sources","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'4 Min Read'","'HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG ('","') is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd"," two sources told Reuters"," as the German firm accelerates its electric push into the world’s largest auto market. '","'The deal would mark Volkswagen’s first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker and comes as the Wolfsburg-based automaker strives to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) a year in China by 2025"," including plug-in hybrid cars. '","'The top foreign automaker in China plans to acquire the stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan via a discounted private share placement in the coming weeks"," the two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Based on Guoxuan’s market capitalization of $2.8 billion"," a 20% stake in the company at present is worth about $560 million.  '","'The deal’s details have been mostly finalized and the two firms are waiting for new Chinese regulatory rules on private share placements that will provide a more flexible pricing mechanism and shorter lock-up periods for majority shareholders"," said one of the people"," speaking on condition of anonymity. '","'After the stake purchase"," Volkswagen will become the battery maker’s second-largest shareholder with a 20% stake"," behind Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd"," a firm controlled by Guoxuan’s founder Li Zhen"," which currently holds 25%.  '","'Shares in Guoxuan surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Friday to trade at their highest level since March last year.  '","'Volkswagen declined to comment. Guoxuan and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. '","'An executive at Guoxuan’s board secretary’s office told the government-backed Securities Times newspaper it had not yet received news about a stake acquisition. '","'Guoxuan is among a swathe of mid-tier Chinese battery makers behind CATL and BYD. It is based in China’s eastern city of Hefei"," where Volkswagen is also building electric vehicles with JAC Motor"," one of a number of its Chinese joint venture partners. '","'A third source"," who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter"," said Volkswagen has long wanted to control a battery maker to better manage its supply chain. '","'To achieve its NEV sales goal in China"," Volkswagen has built a new $2.5 billion electric vehicle plant with partner SAIC Motor that will have annual output capacity of 300","000 cars and is also revamping manufacturing facilities in China’s southeastern city of Foshan to build electric cars with partner FAW Group. '","'Volkswagen has also identified CATL as a strategic supplier and Volkswagen board member Stefan Sommer told Reuters in July last year that it could even build its own battery cell manufacturing plants in China. '","'“By holding a stake in the top Chinese battery makers"," carmakers can gain more bargaining power on battery prices","” said Yale Zhang"," managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. “Foreign carmakers are now catching up with their Chinese counterparts on securing battery supplies in China.”  '","'Volkswagen’s rivals in China include Tesla"," which earlier this month began delivering cars from its $2 billion factory in China. The U.S. electric car maker eventually plans to manufacture 250","000 vehicles a year in the plant’s first phase.  '","'China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric"," hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers. '","'However"," cuts to subsidies have dealt the market a blow"," with NEV sales contracting for the first time last year.

'","'With the widespread rollout of autonomous vehicles still years away"," the two industries have converged on the idea of cars providing services and features delivered “over the air” - that is"," over the same wireless data networks used by smart phones.  '","'Those services - streaming video"," vehicle performance upgrades"," dashboard commerce - could answer a pressing need for automakers. They need to learn how to milk their hardware for revenue long after vehicles roll off dealers’ lots. Tech companies see cars and the time people spend in them as a new frontier for growth.  '","'Both auto and tech companies used the big CES technology show here this week to showcase their determination to make the vision of vehicles as connected revenue machines a reality. Cloud computing giants Amazon.com Inc ('","') and Microsoft Corp ('","') were in the forefront"," chasing the opportunity to manage torrents of data flowing to and from connected vehicles. '","'“It’s absolutely huge","” General Motors Co ('","') President Mark Reuss said in December of the opportunities to generate revenue after a vehicle is sold by providing streamed services and over-the-air upgrades facilitated by GM’s new high-capacity onboard electrical system.  '","'The pivot comes at a time when global automakers are looking for fresh revenue sources as sales slow and as rising costs to comply with tougher emissions standards threaten profit margins. Shares of legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co ('","') and GM badly lagged broader market indexes in 2019. The contrast is Tesla Inc ('","')"," whose market cap on Wednesday for the first time exceeded Ford and GM’s combined market values. '","'Tesla pioneered the model for charging for over-the-air upgrades"," now asking customers to pay $6","000 to turn on the full self-driving option. '","'Other automakers are eager to try their hand at turning cars into upgradeable"," revenue-generating gadgets. '","'Chinese carmaker Byton’s new M-Byte sedan features a 48-inch screen as a dashboard"," as well as a steering-wheel display and a digital tablet for passengers. When parked"," the car can be an office"," enabling video conference calls"," or a roadside cinema.

BMW executive Klaus Froehlich told Reuters the automaker is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get U.S. approval for the seats"," but could not say when they would appear in production. '","'Tech companies and suppliers want to accelerate the transformation of vehicles into subscription bundle-ready machines by helping automakers sort out the tangle of computer chips that make most current vehicles difficult or impossible to upgrade over the air. '","'The current crazy quilt of vehicle processors “is not cost effective"," and it’s hard to get (vehicles) developed and launched so that everything works all the time","” said Glen De Vos"," chief technology officer of auto supplier Aptiv Plc ('","').

'","'Harman"," a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ('","')"," is also pushing a similar digital platform to control the flow of data in and out of the car.

'","'Harman"," which supplies some of the technology that automakers including Tesla use to deliver the over-the-air upgrades"," plans to sell its new vehicle computing brain with cybersecurity features built in - but some car buyers will have to pay to turn it on. '","'Qualcomm Inc ('","')"," which already provides the cellular modem chips that allow vehicles to connect to the internet"," introduced a more comprehensive computing system that can manage in-vehicle entertainment and help the car drive itself.

safety agency opens probe into fatal Tesla crash in Indiana","ticker":"TSLA","content":["'3 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. '","'The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA’s special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company’s so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.  '","'It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was  investigating in recent weeks. Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. Tesla did not immediately comment. '","'NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena"," California. In that incident"," the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway"," ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic"," killing its two occupants. '","'Also in December"," NHTSA had said it was investigating a crash in which a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut. '","'The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards"," especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention"," but which cannot completely replace human drivers. '","'The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot’s lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City"," California"," Tesla crash that the system’s design “permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.” '","'Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot “enables your car to steer"," accelerate and brake automatically within its lane","” but does not make the vehicle autonomous. '","'Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system.

'","'Privately-held Bosch said the internally-developed lidar sensor"," which it will show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week"," will cover both long and close ranges on highways and in the city and will work in conjunction with the company’s camera and radar technologies. '","'Lidar technology"," which uses light-based sensors to generate a three-dimensional view of the road"," remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux. In its current form"," it is too expensive for mass market use"," but if a cheaper lidar sensor were widely adopted"," it could provide more depth data that would allow self-driving cars to detect the distance to other road users like pedestrians. '","'While numerous start-ups are working on lidar"," the involvement of large and trusted suppliers like Bosch could help speed adoption of the technology. '","'“Bosch is making automated driving a viable possibility in the first place","” Bosch management board member Harald Kroeger said in a statement. '","'Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars"," lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car"," such as near the headlights.

'","'Bosch did not provide a timeline"," pricing or technology details for its lidar"," but a spokesman said the company is working on making the sensors “production ready” and the focus will be on “affordable mass market” technology. '","'The spokesman declined to say whether Bosch already had auto customers for the sensor. '","'The development of self-driving cars has hit a speed bump as costs and regulatory concerns cause automakers and tech companies to rethink their plans. '","'Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co ('","')"," Ford Motor Co ('","') and Alphabet Inc’s ('","') Waymo. Apple Inc ('","') also is evaluating the technology. '","'Others are less enthusiastic about adopting lidar"," citing a high cost and limited capabilities - including Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc ('","') and Nissan Motor Co Ltd ('","'). '","'Last April"," Musk called lidar “a fool’s errand” that was too costly and said anyone relying on the technology was “doomed.” Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving.

'","'The Philippines was the deadliest country for a third year with 50 killings"," or nearly one killing per week"," it said. '","'Here is a look at eight property rights disputes that broke new ground in 2019:  '","'1. River rights: In February"," voters in Ohio approved the Lake Erie Bill of Rights to amend the Toledo city charter to state that Lake Erie had the right to “exist"," flourish"," and naturally evolve” and to do so free of violation. '","'It is part of a growing global movement as environmentalists try new legal routes to protect the planet - vesting rivers"," reefs and threatened habitats with “rights of nature” that override the long-held human right to harm.       '","'2. Floating homes: In April"," Thai authorities threatened death sentences for a couple who had set up an offshore home near a Thai island. '","'But even that failed to damp the “seasteading” movement that claims the right to floating settlements that advocates say are more sustainable than land reclamation.  '","'With 90% of the world’s largest cities vulnerable to flooding"," a United Nations-backed partnership earlier said it would study the prospect of floating cities.     '","'3. Rooster rules: In September"," a French court ruled that Maurice the rooster could continue his dawn crowing despite complaints from neighbors"," in a case cast as a battle between the old rural way of life and modern values creeping in from the city. '","'It also highlighted the increasing fights among property owners over sights"," sounds"," and smells they find disturbing. '","'4. Face off: Also in September"," California’s legislature passed a three-year ban on state and local law enforcement from using body cameras with facial recognition software"," a sign of the growing backlash against the technology that human rights campaigners say poses a threat to civil liberties.  '","'San Francisco and Oakland voted earlier to ban city personnel from using the technology.     '","'5. Space jam: Hotels"," insurance"," advertising billboards"," and in-space manufacturing are among the business opportunities firms are exploring amid a boom in commercial space activity. '","'Billionaires Elon Musk"," Tesla’s chief executive"," and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are pouring cash into cutting-edge private spacecraft"," even as astronomers complained that the 120 satellites Musk’s SpaceX launched this year are jeopardizing space research. Thousands more are due to be launched. '","'6. Sidewalk squeeze: The fight for sidewalk space is getting more heated"," with pedestrians in Singapore winning the battle in November after a fatality led to a ban on electric scooters on pavements. Countries such as France"," Germany and Britain earlier imposed similar bans.    '","'7. Hologram stars: Ethical and practical questions swirled over who owns the intellectual property rights of dead celebrities being resurrected with computer generated images and holograms. '","'Six-time Grammy winner Amy Winehouse"," who died in 2011"," was to be featured in a holographic show slated to launch at the end of 2019. It was postponed after the producer said it had run into some “unique challenges and sensitivities”. '","'A Whitney Houston hologram tour featuring the late singer’s image accompanied by her original backing band is also planned. '","'Iconic actor James Dean"," who died in a car crash in 1955"," is to star in a new movie"," where he will be recreated through a mixture of old photos and footage"," along with computer generated creations.

'","'In Spain"," thousands of empty villages are up for sale"," some for less than 100","000 euros ($113","000). '","'Meanwhile"," a holyman who is on the run after charges of abduction and rape in India"," has declared the creation of a new country for Hindus"," Kailaasa https://kailaasa.org"," with its own flag"," government and passport.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author"," a columnist for Reuters) '","'* Lithium prices sink: '","' '","'* Cobalt boom and bust: '","' '","'By Andy Home '","'LONDON"," Dec 18 (Reuters) - It’s been a tough year for electric vehicle (EV) metal bulls. '","'The previous speculative heat surrounding any and every material that goes into an EV battery has dissipated over the course of 2019. '","'Two years ago the spot lithium price in China was $26 per kilogram. Today it is assessed by Fastmarkets at below $8. '","'Cobalt"," a key input for lithium-ion battery chemistry"," has experienced a similar boom and bust cycle"," the price of standard grade metal sliding from over $44 per lb in the second quarter of 2018 to a current $15.75. '","'Nickel has fared better but only thanks to strength in its traditional end-use sector"," stainless steel"," rather than any pull from the battery sector. '","'Both lithium and cobalt are living with the consequences of previous price exuberance in the form of a supply surge that has swamped processing capacity and left an overhang of stock. '","'The impact has been accentuated by an unexpected slowdown in demand from the EV sector in China"," where sales have fallen for five months and are expected to record a loss for this year. '","'China accounts for just over half of global EV sales in 2018"," according to the Edison Electric Institute. '","'Global sales of EVs this year through to October have risen 13%"," compared with 64% in 2018. '","'The EV revolution appears to have stalled this year"," challenging previous expectations for future growth. '","'Appearances can be deceptive"," however"," and there is accumulating evidence that the next demand wave is building. '","'It’s only a question of when it breaks and washes through the market. And will producers be ready when it does? '","'China is at the forefront of the EV revolution and it is weakness in the Chinese market that has caused a collective double-take on the EV story. '","'Chinese sales of new electric vehicles (NEV) fell by 44% year-on-year in November. It was the fifth straight month of contraction"," reducing the year-to-date growth rate to just 2%. There is now the distinct possibility that full-year sales will fall below 2018 levels"," according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). '","'Analysts at Macquarie Bank agree"," forecasting NEV sales in China to slide by 6% this year"," compared with a previous forecast for 10% growth and actual average growth of 98% in each of the previous four years. (“Commodities Compendium”"," Dec. 12"," 2019) '","'This is part of a broader downturn in the Chinese automotive sector but the specific weakness in EV sales is down to an overhaul of Beijing’s subsidy system in the second quarter of 2019. '","'It’s not the first time China has rejigged its EV subsidies but it is the first time that sales have been impacted so severely. '","'The proposed phase-out of subsidies altogether next year threatens more sales disruption but Beijing might well change tack. It has just set a target for NEVs to account for 25% of all car sales in 2025"," up from 5% last year. '","'That’s going to be hard to achieve without some form of incentive scheme. '","'Moreover"," next year will see the EV baton pass to Europe"," where automakers are now racing towards electrification to beat new carbon dioxide emissions regulations. '","'Macquarie notes that NEV penetration in the European market was 4% in October"," beating China into second place. “We have become more bullish about European prospects for EV sales and now see the region overtaking China in terms of market penetration by 2023","” it said. '","'A milestone will come with the launch of Volkswagen’s ID.3"," a passenger car promising long-range capability at an affordable price. '","'It will mark the first significant entry by a mass automaker into a space previously dominated by Tesla. '","'Where Volkswagen leads"," other European automakers will follow. And they will all need batteries. '","'The interest in long-term supply deals"," such as that just signed between BMW and China’s Ganfeng Lithium belies tepid consumer activity in the spot market. '","'Investment in battery-cell manufacturing facilities is also surging as the industry builds out the capacity needed to power its electric dreams. '","'“The rate at which battery megafactories have been announced has dramatically increased over the past twelve months"," with the number of factories and capacity almost doubling","” according to analysts at Benchmark Minerals. (“Cathodes 2019: Key Talking Points”"," Nov. 21"," 2019) '","'Benchmark Minerals is now tracking 103 megafactory projects with a projected 2","028 GWh of capacity in the pipeline for 2028. '","'Battery-makers"," meanwhile"," are shifting towards chemistries that need more metals such as cobalt and nickel"," cushioning the impact of falling EV sales in the Chinese market. '","'The average EV sold globally contained 22% more nickel"," 19% more cobalt and 15% more manganese in October than the same month last year"," according to Adamas Intelligence. '","'These underlying drivers of future EV metals demand are still accelerating"," even as visible end-user demand in the form of EV sales appears to be slowing. '","'The current supply gluts in both lithium and cobalt are testament to both markets’ problems in matching output with demand. '","'“Demand for lithium accelerated much faster than we anticipated back in 2017","” according to Luke Kissam"," chief executive of Albemarle Corp"," the world’s largest producer. '","'The ensuing price spike then incentivised too much production"," particularly from a new generation of hard-rock spodumene miners in Australia. '","'Lithium producers are now dealing with the consequences by cutting output and trimming expansion plans. '","'Glencore is doing the same in the cobalt market by placing its Mutanda mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo on care and maintenance for two years. '","'Supply discipline should help stabilise prices and erode stocks although most analysts think things could get a little worse before they get better. '","'Will Adams"," analyst at Fastmarkets"," for example"," is bearish on lithium prices “for most of 2020” and thinks cobalt will be flat at current levels for the first half of next year before rising in the second half. (“Battery Raw Materials Market Tracker”"," Dec. 17"," 2019). '","'However"," everyone is still bullish on the long-term story. '","'Albemarle forecasts lithium demand to hit one million tonnes by 2025. It and other established lithium players are confident they can lift production accordingly. '","'The boom and bust cycle of the last couple of years doesn’t inspire much confidence in producers’ collective ability to manage the next demand surge in either the lithium or cobalt markets. '","'Many junior miners and exploration companies"," meanwhile"," have either been forced out of business or gone in search of other metals. '","'It’s easy to see how current supply feast could easily turn into famine when the EV revolution goes from current pause to fast forward. '","'We may not have long to wait to find out.

'","'The legal complaint on behalf of 14 families from Congo was filed on Sunday by International Rights Advocates"," a U.S.-based human rights non-profit"," against Tesla Inc"," Apple Inc"," Alphabet Inc"," Microsoft Corp and Dell Technologies Inc.. '","'The companies were part of a system of forced labor that the families claimed led to the death and serious injury of their children"," it said.

'","'“These companies - the richest companies in the world"," these fancy gadget-making companies - have allowed children to be maimed and killed to get their cheap cobalt","” Terrence Collingsworth"," an attorney representing the families"," told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  '","'Cobalt is essential in making rechargeable lithium batteries used in millions of products sold by the tech industry. '","'More than half of the world’s cobalt is produced in Congo. '","'Global demand for the metal is expected to increase at 7% to 13% annually over the next decade"," according to a 2018 study by the European Commission.  '","'The lawsuit said the children"," some as young as 6 years old"," were forced by their families’ extreme poverty to leave school and work in cobalt mining owned by the British mining company Glencore. Glencore has previously been accused of using child labor. '","'Some children were paid as little as $1.50 per day"," working 6 days a week"," it said. '","'In response to a request for comment"," Dell said in an email that it has “never knowingly sourced operations” using child labor and has launched an investigation into the allegations. '","'A spokesperson for Glencore said: “Glencore notes the allegations contained in a U.S. lawsuit filed on 15th December 2019. '","'“Glencore’s production of cobalt in the DRC is a by-product of our industrial copper production. Glencore’s operations in the DRC do not purchase or process any artisanally mined ore. '","'“Glencore does not tolerate any form of child"," forced"," or compulsory labor.” '","'Tesla"," Apple"," Google"," Microsoft did not immediately respond for comment. '","'The legal complaint argued that the companies all have the ability to overhaul their cobalt supply chains to ensure safer conditions.  '","'“I’ve never encountered or documented a more severe asymmetry in the allocation of income between the top of the supply chain and the bottom","” said Siddharth Kara"," a researcher on modern slavery who is an expert witness in the case. '","'“It’s that disconnect that makes this perhaps the worst injustice of slavery and child exploitation that I’ve seen in my two decades research","” Kara said.

'","'Top energy firms including BP"," Repsol"," Royal Dutch Shell and Total - as well as Norway’s Equinor - have in recent months pledged to cut carbon dioxide emissions and provide more information about their role in global warming. '","'Many environmentalists argue the targets do not go far enough"," but the supportive comments from the Norwegian fund - which owns 1.5% of all globally listed equities - could help to persuade other investors that sufficient progress is being made.  '","'“European oil companies have moved a long way"," the clever detail and the comprehensiveness of reporting is quite different and much improved from what we saw a decade ago","” the fund’s chief executive"," Yngve Slyngstad"," said in an interview. '","'Slyngstad’s comments came as the fund"," built up itself from the proceeds of Norway’s extensive oil and gas resources"," reported a 19.9% return on investment last year and record earnings of 1.69 trillion Norwegian crowns ($180 billion)"," helped by surging stock markets.

'","'“It is something that in general we welcome as an investor"," that the companies are aware of these issues and ... are publicising to us the relevant numbers to see how they move. But we do not get involved in their strategy","” he added. '","'Slyngstad said Europe in general had moved further on tackling climate change than other regions"," and that this was reflected in actions taken by companies. '","'The fund said its return for 2019 was ahead of its benchmark index and amounted to almost $34","000 for each of Norway’s 5.3 million people. The overall value of the fund is now equivalent to about $207","000 for every man"," woman and child in the country. '","'Apple ('","') and Microsoft ('","') contributed the most to the fund’s return in 2019"," followed by Nestle ('","')"," while the worst performers were Nokia ('","')"," Pfizer ('","') and Swedbank ('","')"," it said. '","'The fund holds stakes in more than 9","000 companies globally"," and also invests in bonds and real estate.

'","'In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc ('","') shareholders"," Buffett said pay for outside directors has “soared” to levels that might threaten their independence"," sometimes reaching $250","000 to $300","000 for two weeks work"," while “generous” age limits ensure “fabulous” job security. '","'Buffett said this can make even “independent” directors resist challenging bad decisions by CEOs"," especially in takeovers.

'","'Berkshire has more than 90 operating units such as the BNSF railroad"," Geico auto insurer"," and Dairy Queen ice cream. '","'Its own 14-person board is no paragon of youth"," with six directors — including the 89-year-old Buffett — over age 70 and three in their 90s. '","'And the voting influence of most Berkshire directors is limited because Buffett"," considered by many among the world’s greatest investors"," controls nearly one-third of the voting power despite owning only about one-sixth of Berkshire’s stock. '","'Still"," no Berkshire director was paid more than $7","300 for their work at the company in 2018"," a regulatory filing shows"," though several including Buffett and Microsoft Corp ('","') co-founder Bill Gates are billionaires"," and can afford it.

'","'The deadly virus spread to hundreds of people in Chinese prisons"," contributing to a jump in reported cases beyond the epicenter in Hubei province"," including 100 more in South Korea. '","'The virus has emerged in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China"," killing 11 people"," according to a Reuters tally. Data shows mainland China had 889 new confirmed cases and 118 deaths"," with most of those in the provincial capital of Wuhan"," which remains under virtual lockdown. '","'The CBOE market volatility index"," the market’s “fear gauge","” rose more than 13% in the biggest single-day jump since late January. Crude oil prices slid about 1% and the U.S. dollar fell across the board. '","'Heading into the weekend"," investors decided to book profits on the possibility of more coronavirus news"," said JJ Kinahan"," chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. '","'The coronavirus has become this year’s worry"," much as the U.S.-China trade war was in 2019"," he said. '","'MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.85% and emerging market stocks lost 1.13%. '","'The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.49% as shares fell from record highs on Thursday. A raft of disappointing earnings added to fears about the global impact of the coronavirus outbreak. '","'Auto stocks led losses in Europe"," down 1.9% in their worst session in four weeks. The sector is the worst-performing among major regional sectors"," off more than 8% so far this year. '","'On Wall Street"," the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 271.58 points"," or 0.93%"," to 28","948.4"," the S&P 500 lost 41.25 points"," or 1.22%"," to 3","331.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 195.95 points"," or 2.01%"," to 9","555.01. '","'U.S. stocks were beaten down by concerns about the virus and after data showed U.S. business activity stalled in February"," signaling a contraction for the first time since 2016. '","'U.S. chipmakers fell sharply. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid 2.99%"," on track for its worst one-day drop since Jan 31"," when fears about the health crisis pummeled markets. '","'A flash reading of the IHS Markit services sector Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to its lowest level since October 2013. The manufacturing sector also clocked its lowest reading since August. '","'Heavyweights Microsoft Corp"," Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc led U.S. stocks lower for a second straight day. '","'The dollar index fell 0.587%"," with the euro up 0.67% to $1.0855. '","'The Japanese yen strengthened 0.52% versus the greenback at 111.57 per dollar. '","'While markets had largely brushed aside fears of long-term economic damage from the virus"," a steady drip of new cases in countries beyond China has kept concerns alive. '","'Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below 1.5% for the first time since early September"," while the 30-year long bond fell to 1.886%"," an all-time low. '","'The 10-year note rose 20/32 in price to push its yield down to 1.4595%. '","'Germany’s 10-year government bond yield bounced off four-month lows after a batch of business surveys delivered healthier-than-expected views of the euro zone economy. '","'Oil prices slid as investors fretted about crude demand being pinched by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak"," while leading producers appeared to be in no rush to curb output. '","'Brent crude settled down 81 cents at $58.50 a barrel. U.S. crude dropped 50 cents to settle at $53.38 a barrel. '","'U.S. gold futures settled up 1.7% at $1","648.80 an ounce. '","'Spot gold rose 3.7% for the week"," marking its biggest weekly gain since early August.

spends $2.5 billion to get second Vision Fund off the ground: sources","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'5 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp ('","') has pumped $2.5 billion of its own cash into new investments since October"," people familiar with the matter said"," hoping to restore its money-making credentials as it courts investors for a successor to its Vision Fund. '","'The Japanese technology conglomerate is also considering investing another $2.5 billion of its own money"," one of the people said. '","'SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said last week the company may spend up to two years investing its own money in a bridge fund"," to build a portfolio that will give investors enough confidence to participate in a second Vision Fund. To that end"," he said SoftBank has already invested “billions” of U.S. dollars"," but he did not provide an exact figure. '","'SoftBank was targeting a $108 billion fundraise for the second Vision Fund"," and had committed $38 billion of its own money toward that goal. However"," Son said last week its launch had been delayed due to investor “concerns” about the performance of the first $100 billion Vision Fund. '","'The pace of SoftBank’s latest investments contrasts markedly with that of the first Vision Fund"," which spent over $80 billion after its first major fundraising close in May 2017. '","'The fund’s investment spree drove a rally in the valuations of a number of technology start-ups"," such as office space-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc ('","'). This rally fizzled out once these companies’ losses mounted along with their breakneck growth. '","'SoftBank was forced to save WeWork from bankruptcy last year in a roughly $10 billion financing deal"," while Uber’s shares are trading more than 10% below the price of their initial public offering in March 2019"," even after a recent rally. '","'Last week"," SoftBank said the first Vision Fund had realized $9.5 billion in cash and mark-to-market gains as of December-end. That represents a 9.5% gain since its first major fundraising close"," versus 25% in the S&P 500 Index over the same period. '","'SoftBank has made seven investments since October - including U.S. drug retailer Alto Pharmacy and Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart - and has half a dozen more in the pipeline"," Rajeev Misra"," a SoftBank executive who also runs the Vision Fund"," said at an investment conference in Abu Dhabi last week. '","'Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) account for the bulk of the first Vision Fund at $60 billion. They have yet to commit to the second fund. '","'Son spoke to Mubadala executives last week to convince them that the turnaround the Vision Fund was implementing in its investment portfolio was working"," said one of the people"," who declined to be identified as the information was not public. '","'SoftBank and PIF declined to comment. A Mubadala spokesman said his company was a long-term partner of SoftBank"," with which it was in regular discussion. '","'Bridge funds are commonly deployed by private equity and venture capital fund managers struggling with their investment track record"," in order to attract investors reluctant to commit to blind pools of capital. '","'In 2014"," loyal investors helped TPG Capital Management LP raise a $2 billion bridge fund after the buyout firm’s previous $19 billion fund suffered losses in key investments. TPG rolled that bridge fund into a new $10.5 billion fund in 2016 after securing enough investor support. '","'In SoftBank’s case"," the bridge capital has come exclusively from the company itself. SoftBank has 3.8 trillion yen ($34.65 billion) in cash on hand but is currently being pressured by Elliott Management Corp to buy back shares"," to boost the value of what the hedge fund considers underperforming stock. '","'SoftBank also has developed a hedge fund overseen by Misra"," the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. '","'In July"," SoftBank said investors including Microsoft Corp ('","')"," Apple Inc APPL.O"," Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) ('","') and Japanese banks were willing to commit $108 billion to the second Vision Fund. '","'Seven months later"," the fund has not received any money from outside investors. '","'Meanwhile"," the first Vision Fund has invested $80.5 billion in 88 companies"," SoftBank disclosed last week. While it raised over $100 billion"," the fund needs to retain the remainder for potential re-investment in portfolio companies"," as well as for coupon payments on outstanding debt"," Son said.

'","'Nvidia is the second chipmaker after Qualcomm Inc ('","') to warn about a potential impact on its businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak. '","'Nvidia’s largest market is chips that enhance the graphics in video games played on PCs and laptops.

'","'Revenue from Nvidia’s closely watched data center chips business rose 42.6% to $968 million in its fiscal fourth quarter"," beating analysts’ estimate of $829 million"," according to research firm FactSet. '","'Nvidia did not name big customers but said that “hyperscale” customers drove the increased data center sales"," a group that industry analysts often define as major cloud computing vendors such as Alphabet Inc’s ('","') Google"," Amazon.com’s ('","') cloud unit and Microsoft Corp ('","'). '","'Artificial intelligence chips for data centers come in two broad types: “training” chips that ingest data and train a software to carry out tasks like recognizing a face"," and “inference” chips that use the trained algorithms to carry out the task.

'","'But Nvidia executives said the company’s inference revenue grew by a factor of four over the past year"," thanks to a new chip.

'","'“I would expect inference to grow"," and I would expect training to grow","” Huang said. '","'The Santa Clara"," California-based company said it expects current-quarter revenue of $3 billion"," plus or minus 2%"," the midpoint of which is above analysts’ expectation of $2.86 billion"," according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  '","'The company said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China"," a major market for both its gaming and data center chips"," was unclear but it has reduced its sales outlook by $100 million in response.

'","'“We had expected a weaker outlook for its April quarter as Nvidia does have a very high gaming GPU sales exposure in China","” said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group. “We believe the continued strength in Nvidia’s data center business is able to partially offset the demand weakness in its consumer gaming business in China due to the coronavirus outbreak.” '","'Nvidia said it expects its $6.8 billion acquisition of Israeli chip firm Mellanox Technologies Ltd ('","') will close in the “early part of calendar 2020.” Nvidia still needs approval from Chinese regulators.

'","'By Jason Bordoff '","'(Reuters) - Beyond Petroleum is back. '","'That was the slogan of a BP Plc ad campaign launched in 2000 to promote its efforts in renewable energy. BP’s chief Lord John Browne famously called on the oil and gas industry to address climate change and pivoted the firm toward renewables — an effort ahead of its time.  '","'Now Big Oil is claiming to take up the climate mantle under rising pressure from investors and activists. While skepticism is warranted"," the latest corporate pledges are compelling. If backed by real action"," they mean these firms’ own economic interests will require they move away from oil and gas and push for stronger climate policy. '","'BP this week became the most recent oil major to announce a climate target"," promising not only to reduce emissions from its operations to zero and the carbon in all the fuel it sells by half but also by 2050 to bring to net zero the emissions released when the oil and gas it extracts is burned. This follows pledges from Shell"," Total and Equinor to cut the carbon intensity of their businesses in half by 2050. '","'Words are meaningless unless backed by action"," but these promises matter for three reasons. '","'First"," committing to zero out the emissions from the use of energy it produces means BP is promising to be a fundamentally different company by 2050.  '","'Reducing carbon intensity can be achieved by acquiring a renewables firm on top of a company’s existing oil and gas operations"," but that would just be an accounting exercise that did not reduce total emissions. This goes further. An oil major may offset some of the emissions from the oil it produces with trees or carbon capture"," but bringing that to zero means it will be producing far more low-carbon energy and far less oil and gas in 2050. '","'Many oil and gas chiefs remain reluctant to commit to reduce emissions from the use of the oil they extract"," arguing that they cannot control whether the cars Ford builds or planes Boeing designs run on oil. Commitments like BP’s move beyond that debate over responsibility for so-called Scope 3 emissions"," which are indirect emissions in a company’s value chain including from use of products sold","  by signaling a fundamental shift in corporate strategy toward new and cleaner energy businesses. '","'Second"," corporate commitments to decarbonize align the incentives for oil and gas firms to advocate for stronger climate policy with their own economic interests. Individual corporate shifts toward greener energy"," whether from BP"," BlackRock or Microsoft"," are welcome but insufficient unless they are also matched by policy advocacy. '","'There is a limit to how much any one company’s actions can reduce emissions unless the energy system as a whole evolves. If a single firm decides to cut back"," many others can step in to produce or finance that oil and gas supply"," which will not change unless demand does. '","'Real corporate leadership on climate thus requires advocating for stronger policy to change the systemic economic incentives that determine how people produce and consume energy. BP’s prioritization of policy advocacy in its announcement is notable - and will be watched closely given past behavior"," such as helping defeat a carbon tax proposal in Washington state. '","'If the company’s new aims are met with action"," however"," it will now be in BP’s own economic interest to advocate for stronger climate policy. The challenge for oil and gas firms today is that they face increasing pressure to shift their investments toward lower carbon forms of energy"," yet if they move too quickly"," shareholders can penalize them for not delivering the same returns and dividends. '","'For the increasing investments in low-carbon energy to pay off"," firms will need stronger climate policy. BP will also need to explain to investors and activists alike how any new oil and gas project is consistent with its 2050 target. '","'Third"," if they shift a much larger share of their capital budgets to clean energy than is the case today"," oil and gas majors can help scale a broader range of low-carbon solutions that will be needed to decarbonize the world’s energy mix while meeting growing energy demand. '","'Deep decarbonization involves far more than just generating electricity from renewables. Hard-to-abate sectors like industry"," heating"," shipping"," aviation and trucking will require different solutions"," such as carbon capture"," carbon removal"," hydrogen"," biogas"," biofuels and more. Large oil and gas companies have the engineering"," capital and project management capabilities to develop and scale such technologies.  '","'Delivering the climate solutions needed means business as usual for oil firms is no longer an option. At the same time"," transitioning to clean energy will not keep firms financially viable or reduce emissions unless climate policy keeps pace. Companies that want to lead must now match words with action through their investments"," technologies and especially policy advocacy.

titans’ shares have attained unusual status: a combined weight of 10% of the benchmark S&P 500 index. '","'For some stock watchers"," this is an example of worrisome concentration that could undermine Wall Street’s record run. The S&P 500"," which many use a proxy for the overall market"," is a market-cap weighted index"," meaning that large stocks carry more influence. '","'The last time a year ended with two stocks amounting to at least one-tenth of the S&P 500 was 1982"," according to data from Howard Silverblatt"," senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices"," when IBM and AT&T amounted to about 10.9% of the index. '","'As of Monday’s close"," Microsoft represented 5.183% of the index with Apple at 4.835%"," for 10.018% total"," according to Refinitiv data.

'","'Apple and Microsoft together have a greater weight in the S&P 500 than seven of its 11 industry sectors"," including the consumer discretionary and industrials groups. '","'“A small number of names are fuelling a huge part of this rally","” said Matt Maley"," chief market strategist at Miller Tabak"," adding that such a “narrow market” is vulnerable to a 7% to 10% pullback.

'","'Apple and Microsoft also account for 5% of the weight in MSCI’s all-country world index"," a closely-watched barometer of global stocks"," according to Ned Davis Research.

'","'The risk"," Hayes said"," is “that at some point these stocks are no longer going to be propping up the market but instead weighing it down.” '","'“And that would happen in the U.S. and then the U.S. would weigh down the global trend","” Hayes said. '","'GRAPHIC - Apple and Microsoft shares eat the world: '","' '","'The top-heaviness of the market goes beyond just Apple and Microsoft. The top 10 issues in the S&P 500 accounted for 24.2% of the index’s weight"," as of Monday; that would be greater than any year-end mark since 2001"," according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

'","'The queries come as the Justice Department"," the FTC"," state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee are investigating the big tech platforms"," which are accused of unfairly using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets.

'","'FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said notices being issued to Big Tech companies were intended for research but could lead to enforcement action. '","'“If during the study we see that there are transactions that are problematic ... we could go back and initiate enforcement action to deal with those transactions","” said Simons. '","'The notices were not meant to be a warning to the companies but were designed to identify areas that need more antitrust enforcement"," he added.  '","'The FTC will study “hundreds” of acquisitions made by the companies and aims to finish its study “quickly","” agency officials said. '","'“It depends what they do with it","” said Matt Stoller"," research director at the American Economic Liberties Project and a vocal critic of big tech companies. “I’m not going to say this is good until they do something that impacts power.” '","'Google"," Amazon.com"," Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

'","'The tech giants have come under fire from both sides of the political spectrum"," with Republicans irked by what they say is a stifling of conservative voices on social media and Democrats angered by increasing consolidation. '","'Senator Elizabeth Warren"," who is running for president"," has explicitly urged federal regulators to undo “anti-competitive mergers","” including Amazon’s purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos"," Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram"," and Google’s acquisitions of Waze"," Nest and DoubleClick.

'","'“They’ve created a true marketplace for startups. They’ve created a destination for them","” he said.

EU battle '","'* EU antitrust chief mulls rules to rein in tech companies '","'By Foo Yun Chee '","'BRUSSELS"," Feb 12 (Reuters) - Google will on Wednesday seek to overturn the first of three hefty European Union antitrust fines at Europe’s second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power. '","'The company will lay out its arguments against a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission during a three-day hearing at the General Court. '","'EU regulators said this penalty was for Google’s favouring its own price comparison shopping service to the disadvantage of smaller European rivals. '","'The EU has fined Google a total of 8.25 billion euros in three separate cases"," including one involving its Android smartphone operating system. This is four times more than its rival Microsoft’s EU fines of 2.2 billion euros. Both companies’ regulatory troubles in Europe have lasted a decade. '","'Google is expected to launch a three-pronged attack against the Commission’s 2017 decision which also included an order to treat competitors equally. '","'“It is wrong on the law"," the facts"," and the economics. Shopping ads have always helped people find the products they are looking for quickly and easily"," and helped merchants to reach potential customers","” Google said in a statement. '","'The key issue is whether self preferencing is anti-competitive and whether Amazon and eBay should be counted as Google’s rivals. '","'For rivals"," the case centres on Google’s role as a central online gatekeeper. '","'“Google’s search service acts as a de-facto kingmaker. If you are not found"," the rest cannot follow. No company should be allows to abuse such position to promote its own services at the detriment of competitors and consumers alike","” said lawyer Thomas Hoppner who advises clients who are critical of Google. '","'“The judgement will have repercussions for a large variety of industries that depend on fair ranking of their services on Google Search","” he said.

wants Trump to testify on ‘order to screw Amazon’ in Pentagon deal","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'4 Min Read'","'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services said on Monday it was seeking to depose President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying “to screw Amazon” when the Pentagon awarded a contract for cloud computing to rival Microsoft Corp. ('","') '","'The Amazon.com Inc ('","') unit alleged that Trump"," who has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company"," exerted undue influence on the decision to deny it the $10 billion contract. '","'Known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud"," or JEDI"," the contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations. '","'In the lawsuit"," Amazon said it seeks discovery “demonstrating exactly how President Trump’s order to ‘screw Amazon’ was carried out during the decision making process.” '","'Without this"," “the Court cannot objectively and fully evaluate AWS’s credible and well-grounded allegations about bias and bad faith","” the lawsuit said. '","'Bezos also owns the Washington Post"," whose coverage has been critical of Trump. '","'Along with Trump and Esper"," Amazon seeks to depose former Defense Secretary James Mattis"," Pentagon chief information officer Dana Deasy and four other procurement officials"," court records show.  '","'An Amazon spokesperson said that “President Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions – including federal procurements – to advance his personal agenda.  '","'“The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends","” the spokesperson added. '","'The lawsuit also says Amazon’s protest against the decision occurs against the background of impeachment"," “which is grounded in the President’s repeated refusal to separate his personal interests from the national interest.” President Trump has been acquitted on impeachment charges by the Republican-controlled Senate. '","'The lawsuit also mentions other instances of alleged interference from Trump. '","'For example"," his alleged interference in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ award of a $400 million border wall contract to Fisher Industries in December 2019 and a report that Trump intervened in the General Services Administration’s solicitation of bids to move the FBI’s headquarters to a new campus in the suburbs. '","'The current FBI offices are near a Washington hotel owned by Trump’s company. '","'The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment. '","'Last month"," Amazon filed a motion in court to delay the Department of Defense deal with Microsoft until a court rules on its protest of the contract award. '","'The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict of interest allegations.

'","'Clay Magouyrk"," the executive vice president of engineering in Oracle’s cloud unit"," said new data privacy regulations in the European Union and elsewhere mean many businesses must retain data in the country where it is generated"," making it important to offer them cloud data centers in as many places as possible.

'","'“Overall"," the strategy is to put lots of regions around the world to give customers data sovereignty","” he said. '","'Each cloud vendor promotes its data center footprint with different terminology"," but in most cases a “region” can have multiple data centers in physically separate locations called “availability” zones or domains.

'","'“Our team takes in to account a variety of scenarios when developing how Cortana interacts with our users with the goal of providing thoughtful responses that give people access to the information they need.

'","'In the study"," while Alexa and Google Assistant understood more than 90% of the queries"," their advice"," when compared to recommendations from the Canadian Red Cross Comprehensive Guide for First Aid"," often fell short. Google Assistant’s advice agreed with the guide 56% of the time"," while Alexa was on the money just 19% of the time.  '","'Douma gives a striking example. “One trigger we used was ‘Google"," I can’t breathe","’” he said. “And it would play the Faith Hill song ‘Breathe.’” '","'Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana fared worse"," correctly parsing the queries just 17% and 5% of the time respectively.  '","'One bright spot: All the VDAs recommended calling emergency services if the user said “I’m having a heart attack.” '","'Douma and his colleagues put the four VDAs to the test in March 2018. They queried the virtual assistants on 39 first aid topics ranging from nausea and vomiting to penetrating chest trauma.  '","'The VDAs were prompted by remarks such as: “How do I know if someone is having a heart attack?” “What do I do for someone who is having a heart attack?” and “I’m having a heart attack.” '","'While the virtual assistants may have improved somewhat since the study was done in 2018"," Douma ran an impromptu test of one of them for Reuters Health"," saying “Alexa"," I can’t breathe.” Alexa’s response: “Take deep breaths.”  '","'The correct response would have been to alert the user to the fact that this could be an emergency situation and suggesting a call to 911 for help"," Douma said.  '","'Dr. Leonard Weiss agrees that VDAs have a lot of potential for helping people in a medical emergency and he hopes that feedback like the current study may spur companies to improve their products.  '","'“But right now"," as this study shows"," they are not ready","” said Weiss"," an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. “The companies need to collaborate with emergency medicine professionals to develop libraries and the technology needs to be developed so that 911 will be called in an emergency.” '","'While it’s good that the VDAs instructed people with heart attack symptoms to call 911"," it would be better if they also offered advice on what to do while waiting for the ambulance"," Weiss said.

Shareholders won’t miss her: At $121 billion"," Big Blue’s market value has almost halved since she took the reins at the start of 2012. It now has a reputation as a former hardware provider that lost its way when the world moved on. Microsoft’s resurgence under boss Satya Nadella offers the best path ahead.  '","'The two companies were both worth roughly $220 billion when Rometty took charge of IBM. One of her recent strategic moves even echoes those of former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer. He paid way above the odds for a couple of companies in an attempt to leave behind the company’s stodgy image - before being effectively forced out in 2014. Rometty"," meanwhile"," splashed out too much in her $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat unveiled in 2018.  '","'Nadella managed to get past Ballmer’s deals"," despite adding a pricey-looking takeover of his own with LinkedIn"," and has overseen a largely successful upgrade and expansion of its software while also growing its cloud-computing business"," where revenue grew 62% in its most recent quarter. That makes it the main contender to industry leader Amazon. Over the past eight years the value of the company has increased six-fold to $1.3 trillion.  '","'There’s plenty that could go wrong"," of course. Krishna"," who currently leads the cloud division"," was instrumental in the Red Hat deal. That was designed to catapult IBM into the cloud business but has yet to show the purchase was worth the price paid. The fate of Finnish telecom company Nokia provides an instrumental lesson on how turnaround attempts can spiral down. It was once"," like IBM"," a dominant hardware maker before falling on hard times. It sold part of its business to Microsoft – one of Ballmer’s bad deals – and shares in the rest now trade at just 6% of their market high in 2000. Yahoo is another tale of woe. The Internet giant’s main business lost almost all of its value during a 10-year period before it was sold to Verizon.

holiday sales jump as one-day shipping pays dividends, stock up 13%","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'6 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc ('","') on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years. '","'Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade"," putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday"," it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017. '","'Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter"," down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still"," that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon’s continued spending on fast delivery"," which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce"," advertising and cloud computing sales. '","'“We’re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative","” said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the “massively overstated” concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock"," he said. '","'Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter"," despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort"," he said. '","'Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward"," but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020. '","'Jeff Bezos"," Amazon’s chief executive"," said in a statement that the world’s biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime"," a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018. '","'Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery"," television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers"," and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon’s 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market. '","'This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world. '","'Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc ('","') that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season"," reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter. '","'Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31"," Amazon said"," as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior. '","'Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected"," according to IBES data from Refinitiv. '","'The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon’s business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform. '","'This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon"," a company that has long passed up short-term results in favor of bets that could reap it future profit. '","'For instance"," faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798","000 in the quarter"," as it expanded both fulfillment and corporate software roles. '","'Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network"," which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion. '","'Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to Microsoft Corp ('","') in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense"," in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision. '","'Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared"," growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion"," similar to its third-quarter increase. '","'“This is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth"," reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability","” Gene Munster"," managing partner at Loup Ventures"," said in a research note. '","'Amazon’s international business also narrowed losses to $617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc ('","') and other technology industry peers"," which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus. '","'Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India"," which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new $1 billion investment in the country.

cloud revenue regains momentum, sending profit above Street estimates","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'5 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ('","') on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations"," driven by the first acceleration of Azure cloud computing revenue growth in eight quarters amid a pitched battle with Amazon.com Inc’s ('","') cloud unit. '","'Shares of the world’s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella"," who for five years has re-centered Microsoft around the cloud"," renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. '","'Microsoft said Azure"," its primary competitor to Amazon’s cloud"," grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31"," down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter. '","'Microsoft’s chief financial officer"," Amy Hood"," said increased consumption of Azure services"," which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services"," drove the revenue growth. '","'“We did have good usage"," which matters a ton to that number","” Hood told Reuters. “The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.” '","'Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud” - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion"," up from $9 billion the year before. '","'The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%"," versus 62% the year before. '","'Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading. '","'“This quarter was an absolute ‘blow out quarter’ across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud","” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note"," referring to Microsoft’s headquarters location in Redmond"," Washington. '","'Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services"," which rely on data centers that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited “hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.” '","'Microsoft’s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share"," respectively"," compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share"," according to IBES data from Refinitiv. '","'Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centers and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. '","'The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft’s shares up more than 50% in the past year"," as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s ('","') Google. '","'In 2019"," Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market"," compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google"," according to data from Forrester Research. '","'“Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market"," but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers","” said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. '","'The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit"," which includes Azure"," reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter"," versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March"," Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit"," compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion. '","'Its Productivity and Business Process unit"," which contains the LinkedIn social network"," reported $11.8 billion in revenue compared with estimates of $11.4 billion.  '","'Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was $13.2 billion"," compared with estimates of $12.8 billion. Over the past year"," Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from Intel Corp ('","')"," but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns. '","'Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter"," a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.

'","'But four months after the event dubbed “Howdy Modi!","” intended to deepen relations with the wealthy Indian-American minority which has influence in India"," some members of the diaspora have been protesting against a new citizenship law. '","'In the past month"," small demonstrations from Harvard to San Francisco have underlined criticism of what detractors say are Modi’s divisive identity politics.  '","'The law"," which was promised by Modi before he was re-elected and was approved in December"," in effect granted Indian citizenship to non-Muslim religious groups fleeing persecution from three neighboring Muslim-majority countries.  '","'Critics say it is a prelude for the marginalization of Muslims and an affront to India’s secular constitution.   '","'“It is still only a minority"," but the disenchantment (in the diaspora) is real and deep","” said a 50-year-old sociologist who gave her name only as Nidhi to avoid straining relations with older relatives who attended Modi’s rally in Houston.  '","'Nidhi emigrated to the United States when she was five and has taken part in demonstrations against the citizenship law in the U.S. state of Texas. '","'“If we as Indo-Americans don’t raise our voice"," we are complicit","” she said. '","'The latest protests were outside Indian diplomatic missions on Sunday"," India’s Republic Day.

'","'Many in the diaspora cheered Hindu nationalist Modi to an election victory in 2014"," convinced he would transform India into an economic powerhouse.  '","'But India’s economy has been sputtering because of an ailing banking sector and tepid rural demand"," while protests in India"," in which at least 25 people have been killed"," have revived the specter of social unrest after years of stability under Modi. '","'Microsoft Corp’s ('","') India-born CEO"," Satya Nadella"," told Buzzfeed News this month the citizenship law was “bad.”  '","'Even so"," a significant chunk of Indians abroad remain die-hard Modi supporters who have staged their own rallies in favor of the law.

'","'“People believe in the conviction of Mr. Modi. Some transient issue will not affect his popularity","” Chauthaiwale said.  '","'The BJP has launched a social media push with the diaspora"," circulating testimonies from “persecuted minorities in Pakistan” who could benefit from the citizenship law.  '","'But Modi’s critics say cracks are appearing in his overseas support.  '","'“Those who are educated are saying"," ‘Hey"," this is not what we were expecting","’” said Sam Pitroda"," the opposition Congress party’s head of overseas affairs.  '","'Chicago-based Pitroda was unable to provide data"," but said he was getting many calls from worried Indians abroad. '","'Retired engineer Krishna Vavilala"," 82"," was excited by Modi’s rise and recounted being photographed at “Howdy"," Modi!” - which took its name from what is a popular greeting in Texas -  because his beard made him look like the Indian leader.  '","'But recent developments have given him pause.  '","'He suggested that Modi"," who has not answered questions at a press conference in India since coming to power six years ago"," speak to more reporters.

'","'Once a house guest on the MTV reality series The Real World"," most would think Edison is living in dreamland if she reckons professional bowling will ever return to its golden era. '","'In those days Dick Weber was as well known as Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus and Don ‘Mr Bowling’ Carter was the first athlete - in any sport - to ink a $1 million sponsorship deal. '","'But Edison is convinced bowlers will again be household names"," the PBA CEO predicting that broadcast rights will one day be in line with other top North American leagues and prize money worthy of a sport eager to be seen as big time. '","'“My main goal is to make bowling relevant again and we’re going to do that by exposing the product to more people"," getting people to think about bowling more","” Edison told Reuters. '","'“Heading into the 2020 season there is going to be the most bowling on broadcast television in decades.  '","'“What you remember from those good old days on ABC we are heading back in that direction.” '","'For decades the only direction bowling and the PBA had been headed was down. '","'Invented in ancient Egypt"," bowling went from the ‘Alley of Pharaohs’ to a mainstream sport in the U.S."," television doing what it also did for golf in the 1960s"," bringing a new audience and interest. '","'Bowling alleys sprung up on almost every corner"," 12","000 of them by the end of the ‘60s"," with nearly 4.5 million Americans taking up membership in the U.S. Bowling Congress (USBC)"," the sport’s national governing body. '","'Today the USBC membership is less than half that while the millions who religiously tuned into ABC on Saturday afternoons to watch their bowling stars turned off and ratings slumped. '","'But Bowlero Corp."," the world’s largest owner and operator of bowling centers"," and FOX Sports are betting on a revival on the lanes. '","'Last September Bowlero acquired the PBA from Microsoft executive Mike Slade and FOX signed on as the new broadcast partner. '","'The moves have had an immediate impact and appear to have halted the downward trend with television ratings jumping 100% from 2018. '","'The PBA also awarded its first six-figure winner’s purse since 2011 last year and this season boasts a record $2.1 million combined prize fund. '","'While the increase in prize money will be welcomed by bowlers"," the PBA has a long way to go before it is on a par with the PGA Tour"," which is offering a $7.5 million purse this week at the Farmers Insurance Open"," or tennis where the singles champions at the Australian Open will earn $2.85 million.  '","'“There is a lot of room for growth","” said Edison. “What we will be focusing on this year is that rich storytelling and character development. '","'“We have our majors"," our Masters"," our U.S. Open the traditional events but we are embracing change.” '","'In her dual role of PBA CEO and Bowlero’s Chief Customer Officer (CCO)"," Edison"," who began her climb up the Bowlero corporate ladder booking deejays for events"," plans to use the PBA as a vehicle to drive a new generation of bowlers into their alleys and in turn use the centers to promote the PBA. '","'Already part of the Pan Am Games program"," Edison will join the effort to get bowling into the Olympics. '","'There will be new competitions"," new ways of storytelling and hopefully a new cast of characters who could become the face of the sport like Weber"," who was a late night show regular and once bowled in the cargo hold of a Boeing 707 in what was promoted as “Operation AstroBowl” the highest altitude game ever played. '","'As a one-time reality TV show personality"," Edison is keenly aware of the ability of crossover characters to draw attention to a product. '","'Jason Belmonte"," the world’s top ranked bowler"," who bowls using two hands could be one of those marquee names the sport needs but the problem is most Americans would not know the Australian if he bowled a perfect game in New York’s Times Square outside Edison’s office. '","'“He is our Tiger Woods","” Edison said of Belmonte"," the winner of 11 bowling majors. “He is the new era of bowling and really unique in that he bowls with two hands. '","'“When you mine the profiles of our bowlers you will find there are some really great stories and characters and it is just about bringing that out.” '","'(This story fixes typo in second paragraph) '","'Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

'","'The company’s sales in its closely watched data center business jumped 19%"," helping it beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates and sending its shares up 7% in extended trading.

'","'Davis did not name specific customers"," but so-called “hyperscale” cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services ('","') and Microsoft Corp ('","') in the United States and Alibaba Group Holding ('","') and Baidu Inc ('","') all purchase Intel chips for data centers whose capacity they rent out to large businesses. '","'“What we’re seeing is very strong demand from cloud players","” Davis told Reuters. “I have to give credit to the hyperscalers for this quarter.”     '","'Intel said its transition to a newer generation of chipmaking technology was progressing better than it expected and that it would boost its capacity to make chips for personal computers"," in a sign that the manufacturing woes that plagued the chipmakers over the past year were starting to ease.

'","'However"," Intel’s Davis cautioned that the positive forecast was not directly attributable to the trade deal signed between U.S. and Chinese officials last week.  '","'“It’s a little fresh to really have a good understanding of how that specific trade deal is going to have an impact on (Intel’s customers’) thinking","” Davis said. “But we like the demand signals we’re getting.”  '","'After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders"," Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has set a goal of becoming more disciplined about spending"," slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.

'","'Smith"," who is also Microsoft’s chief legal officer"," however cited the benefits of facial recognition technology in some instances such as NGOs using it to find missing children. '","'“I’m really reluctant to say let’s stop people from using technology in a way that will reunite families when it can help them do it","” Smith said. '","'“The second thing I would say is you don’t ban it if you actually believe there is a reasonable alternative that will enable us to"," say"," address this problem with a scalpel instead of a meat cleaver","” he said. '","'Smith said it was important to first identify problems and then craft rules to ensure that the technology would not be used for mass surveillance.

'","'The European Commission s taking a tougher line on artificial intelligence (AI) than the United States that would strengthen existing regulations on privacy and data rights"," according to a proposal paper seen by Reuters. '","'Part of this includes a moratorium of up to five years on using facial recognition technology in public areas"," to give the EU time to work out how to prevent abuses"," the paper said.  '","'Pichai urged regulators to take a “proportionate approach” when drafting rules"," days before the Commission is due to publish proposals on the issue. '","'Regulators are grappling with ways to govern AI"," encouraging innovation while trying to curb potential misuse"," as companies and law enforcement agencies increasingly adopt the technology. '","'There was no question AI needs to be regulated"," Pichai said"," but rulemakers should tread carefully.  '","'“Sensible regulation must also take a proportionate approach"," balancing potential harms with social opportunities. This is especially true in areas that are high risk and high value","” he said. '","'Regulators should tailor rules according to different sectors"," Pichai said"," citing medical devices and self-driving cars as examples that require different rules. He said governments should align their rules and agree on core values. '","'Earlier this month"," the U.S. government published regulatory guidelines on AI aimed at limiting authorities’ overreach"," and  urged Europe to avoid an aggressive approach. '","'Pichai said it was important to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong with AI"," and while it promised huge benefits there were real concerns about potential negative consequences. '","'One area of concern is so-called “deepfakes” - video or audio clips that have been manipulated using AI. Pichai said Google had released open datasets to help the research community build better tools to detect such fakes.

steps to address record or near-record inequality levels within countries that new research shows could be a harbinger of a new financial crisis"," the head of the International Monetary Fund said Friday. '","'IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva issued what she termed a “call to action”"," urging a shift to facilitate more lending to small and women-led businesses"," which in turn would help bolster resilience in the event of a future crisis. '","'“Our new research file:///C:/Users/u8007546/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/C63MH0ID/Financial_Services_and_Inequalities%20SDN%20(003).pdf shows that inequality tends to increase before a financial crisis"," signaling a strong link between inequality and financial stability","” she said"," citing parallels to 1920s boom years that led to the Great Depression. '","'A report by IMF staff released Friday shows that expanding financial services to more low-income households"," women and small businesses could serve as a powerful lever in creating a more inclusive society"," but the increasing complexity of the financial sector often wound up benefitting mainly the wealthy. '","'“If we act"," and act together"," we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1920s in the 2020s","” Georgieva told an event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  '","'The Fund would apply the lessons of the new research to its assessment and surveillance of financial sector stability"," while focusing on bolstered financial literacy among less “sophisticated” populations"," she added. '","'Georgieva"," who served as the World Bank’s chief executive officer before moving to the IMF in October"," has made reversing inequalities one of her top priorities. '","'In her speech on Friday"," she said it was important to maintain high lending standards and good supervision"," but work was needed to reverse widening gaps between rich and poor. '","'Unlike the 1920s"," climate change was a huge factor exacerbating inequality today"," she said"," citing a World Bank estimate that 100 million people could be living in extreme poverty by 2030 if current policies were not changed. '","'The Fund in November called for central banks to develop stress tests for climate risks"," and Georgieva said it would seek to incorporate them into its assessment instruments this calendar year. Devaluing climate-related stranded assets could result in costs of $4 trillion to $20 trillion. '","'Governments should continue using fiscal policies to address growing rates of inequality"," she said"," and avert the populism and political upheaval it could spawn. '","'But the financial sector also had a key role to play"," she said"," citing research by IMF staff that showed a 2-to-3-percentage point difference in longer-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth between financially inclusive countries and their less inclusive peers.

issues critical Windows security fix after tipoff from U.S. NSA","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'3 Min Read'","'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ('","') on Tuesday rolled out an important security fix after the U.S. National Security Agency tipped off the company to a serious flaw in its widely used Windows operating system"," officials said. '","'Microsoft said the flaw could allow a hacker to forge digital certificates used by some versions of Windows to authenticate and secure data. Exploiting the flaw could have potentially serious consequences for Windows systems and users. '","'The NSA and Microsoft said they had not seen any evidence that the flaw had previously been abused"," but both urged Windows users to deploy the update as soon as possible. NSA official Anne Neuberger noted that operators of classified networks had already been prodded to install the update and everyone else should now “expedite the implementation of the patch.”     '","'The Microsoft patch marks the first time the NSA has publicly claimed credit for prompting a software security update"," although the agency said it has alerted companies in the past to flaws in their products. Neuberger said the agency was striving for more transparency with the information security research community.   '","'“Part of building trust is showing the data","” she told reporters in a call just minutes before the patch went live. '","'Experts said the move was unprecedented. '","'“I have never seen this before","” said Tenable Chief Executive Amit Yoran"," who previously served as founding director of the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team. '","'“I cannot think of a single instance where government shared a zero-day with a vendor and took credit for it","” he said in an email. '","'The NSA faces a balancing act when it comes across such vulnerabilities. The agency had been criticized after its cyberspies took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products to deploy hacking tools against adversaries and kept the Redmond"," Washington-based company in the dark about it for years.  '","'When one such tool was dramatically leaked to the internet in 2016"," it was deployed against targets around the globe by hackers of all stripes. '","'In the most dramatic case"," a group used the tool to unleash a massive malware outbreak dubbed WannaCry in 2017. The data-wiping worm wrought global havoc"," affecting what Europol estimated was some 200","000 computers in more than 150 countries. '","'Neuberger did not directly address that controversy in her call but said that the NSA hoped to be “a good cybersecurity partner.”  '","'“We’re working to evolve our mission","” she said.

legal head Drummond exits, giving its new CEO chance to shake up team","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'6 Min Read'","'(Reuters) - Alphabet’s new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday gained the opportunity to reshape the leadership of Google’s parent with the exit of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond"," whose outsized strategic role was overshadowed by employee concerns about his personal relationship with a subordinate. '","'Drummond"," also senior vice president of corporate development"," had been with Google since its start in 1998. He incorporated the company as outside counsel"," winning the business of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He later spent nearly 18 years as the company’s top lawyer and one of its few black executives. '","'Scrutiny centered on Drummond as the board last year investigated the company’s handling of sexual misconduct complaints throughout its workforce"," and he became a lightning rod for criticism about what some employees viewed as tolerance for poor behavior.  '","'Pichai now has his first big chance to make his mark on Alphabet leadership since Page and Brin left him day-to-day reins of the company last month. '","'Drummond’s last day is Jan. 31"," and a replacement has not been decided yet"," Alphabet said. '","'“With Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet"," the company is entering an exciting new phase"," and I believe that it’s also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders","” Drummond said in an email to employees shared by Google.  '","'Some employees had questioned Drummond’s role at the company after the New York Times in 2018 reported on an extramarital affair he had with subordinate"," Jennifer Blakely"," starting in 2004. She told the paper that she was effectively forced to transfer teams to comply with Google’s workplace dating policy.  '","'Blakely had a son with Drummond"," but in August 2019 she publicly criticized him for not providing support. Drummond responded in a statement calling himself “far from perfect.” Blakely did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. '","'Some shareholders have urged Alphabet to make changes that had been within Drummond’s purview"," including greater financial transparency"," bigger share buybacks and a management shakeup. Alphabet shares have risen 6.5% this month as analysts expressed optimism about possible changes. '","'In a departure from company norm"," Drummond is not receiving an exit pay package. In recent weeks"," Drummond sold more than $200 million worth of his Alphabet shares"," leaving him with about $90 million in company stock. '","'He remains a defendant"," alongside other executives"," in a lawsuit shareholders brought last year accusing Alphabet leadership of covering up sexual harassment scandals within the company including by awarding lavish exit packages to two top executives found responsible for misconduct. '","'“While we are glad to see Mr. Drummond is no longer with Alphabet"," we still intend to hold him accountable for fiduciary breaches through our litigation","” said Julie Goldsmith Reiser"," attorney for the lead plaintiffs. '","'The board completed an internal investigation last month"," but has not publicized findings. The litigation is in mediation"," and the board’s findings and resulting actions may become known as it goes on. '","'Pichai in 2018 said Google made mistakes in some cases and introduced new procedures aimed at creating equity and transparency in harassment investigations.  '","'“I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and"," yes"," here at Google"," too","” said Pichai"," who at the time was Google CEO and had not yet gained the additional title of Alphabet CEO.  '","'The #MeToo movement has forced major shake-ups in management and harassment policy across corporate America.  '","'Through blog posts"," congressional appearances and media interviews"," Drummond’s presence was felt in nearly every public battle the company fought as it crippled traditional businesses in media and telecoms on its way to online dominance.

Now"," big tech wants to work with automakers to do the same thing for your car. '","'With the widespread rollout of autonomous vehicles still years away"," the two industries have converged on the idea of cars providing services and features delivered “over the air” - that is"," over the same wireless data networks used by smart phones.  '","'Those services - streaming video"," vehicle performance upgrades"," dashboard commerce - could answer a pressing need for automakers. They need to learn how to milk their hardware for revenue long after vehicles roll off dealers’ lots. Tech companies see cars and the time people spend in them as a new frontier for growth.  '","'Both auto and tech companies used the big CES technology show here this week to showcase their determination to make the vision of vehicles as connected revenue machines a reality. Cloud computing giants Amazon.com Inc ('","') and Microsoft Corp ('","') were in the forefront"," chasing the opportunity to manage torrents of data flowing to and from connected vehicles. '","'“It’s absolutely huge","” General Motors Co ('","') President Mark Reuss said in December of the opportunities to generate revenue after a vehicle is sold by providing streamed services and over-the-air upgrades facilitated by GM’s new high-capacity onboard electrical system.  '","'The pivot comes at a time when global automakers are looking for fresh revenue sources as sales slow and as rising costs to comply with tougher emissions standards threaten profit margins. Shares of legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co ('","') and GM badly lagged broader market indexes in 2019. The contrast is Tesla Inc ('","')"," whose market cap on Wednesday for the first time exceeded Ford and GM’s combined market values. '","'Tesla pioneered the model for charging for over-the-air upgrades"," now asking customers to pay $6","000 to turn on the full self-driving option. '","'Other automakers are eager to try their hand at turning cars into upgradeable"," revenue-generating gadgets. '","'Chinese carmaker Byton’s new M-Byte sedan features a 48-inch screen as a dashboard"," as well as a steering-wheel display and a digital tablet for passengers. When parked"," the car can be an office"," enabling video conference calls"," or a roadside cinema. '","'BMW ('","') showed at its CES display a concept of its future interior with reclining lounge chairs and a windshield with augmented reality built in to annotate the road ahead. BMW executive Klaus Froehlich told Reuters the automaker is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get U.S. approval for the seats"," but could not say when they would appear in production. '","'Tech companies and suppliers want to accelerate the transformation of vehicles into subscription bundle-ready machines by helping automakers sort out the tangle of computer chips that make most current vehicles difficult or impossible to upgrade over the air. '","'The current crazy quilt of vehicle processors “is not cost effective"," and it’s hard to get (vehicles) developed and launched so that everything works all the time","” said Glen De Vos"," chief technology officer of auto supplier Aptiv Plc ('","'). Aptiv’s solution: A new Smart Vehicle Architecture that consolidates most computerized functions. '","'Harman"," a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ('","')"," is also pushing a similar digital platform to control the flow of data in and out of the car. A centralized system"," said Chief Executive Dinesh Paliwal"," would help protect the car against hackers"," who would have only one way in rather than dozens. '","'Harman"," which supplies some of the technology that automakers including Tesla use to deliver the over-the-air upgrades"," plans to sell its new vehicle computing brain with cybersecurity features built in - but some car buyers will have to pay to turn it on. '","'Qualcomm Inc ('","')"," which already provides the cellular modem chips that allow vehicles to connect to the internet"," introduced a more comprehensive computing system that can manage in-vehicle entertainment and help the car drive itself. One element is a much easier way for automakers and their partners to deliver feature upgrades"," such as unlocking a better sound system already built into the car. '","'NXP Semiconductors ('","') is working on a chip that would serve as a gateway between the car and the cloud"," to help automakers cope with the massive amounts of data that sensors and digital cockpits will create. '","'That data has to be stored and managed"," and that’s where cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services come in. AWS announced at CES a partnership with BlackBerry to develop a new software platform for connected vehicles. '","'Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Jane Lanhee Lee in Las Vegas.

'","'The original proposal would have forced all tech players"," in addition to Facebook"," Twitter and WhatsApp"," to deploy automated tools to check for unlawful content and to appoint an officer for “24x7” coordination with law enforcement. '","'The rules are part of India’s broader efforts to tackle disinformation and “fake news”.

'","'But the draft proposals"," called “intermediary guidelines” when they were released in December 2018"," could have applied to a broad range of technology firms including e-commerce players"," cloud storage providers and telecoms companies. '","'India’s IT ministry is now considering a two-tier systems - with stricter rules similar to the original proposals applying only to social media companies"," said the two government sources"," who declined to be named as the plans are still private. '","'“The problem is largely with large messaging platforms"," ones that enable interaction. Some of the requirements for non-social media companies were unrealistic","” one of the officials said. '","'India’s IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment. '","'The second government source said that having two separate layers of rules would mean that big social media companies such as Facebook"," WhatsApp and Chinese video app TikTok would continue to face stricter regulation"," but technology firms such as Amazon.com could breathe easier. '","'The official described the proposed regulation for other technology companies as “minimal” and “simple”"," adding the rules would be finalised later this month. '","'India’s IT ministry has previously said stricter regulations were necessary to safeguard users and the nation’s security as the Internet has emerged as a “potent tool to cause unimaginable disruption to the democratic polity”. '","'The original draft rules also said companies must “remove or disable access” to “unlawful” content within 24 hours"," when asked by a government agency or through a court order. '","'That particular requirement"," however"," would likely stay in the new rules for both social media and other technology firms"," the sources said.

'","'Graphic: Smartphone shipments '","' '","'Access everywhere  '","'Today some 5 billion smartphones are in use around the world"," according to Canalys Research. The total number of internet subscriptions has soared to 7.2 billion globally from 1.3 billion in 2010"," the vast majority of them mobile subscriptions"," International Telecommunications Union data shows.

'","'Graphic: Mobile Broadband Subscriptions '","' '","'Tech uber alles '","'Apple Inc ('","')"," once a niche computer company"," is now one of the world’s most valuable companies thanks to the iPhone. The five largest Fortune 500 technology companies - Apple"," Amazon ('","')"," Google ('","')"," Microsoft ('","') and Facebook ('","') - currently boast a market cap of $4.7 trillion"," compared with about $800 billion for the top five in 2010. Not all of that is due to the smartphone"," of course"," but the mobile-related technologies and services accounted for nearly $4 trillion in economic activity in 2018"," according to trade group GSMA. '","'There’s an app for that '","'Whether we’re hailing a cab"," ordering food"," playing a game"," finding a date"," listening to music or shopping for just about anything"," there’s a good chance we’ll be doing it with a smartphone app that didn’t exist in 2010. Many of most popular apps are free"," but consumers are still expected to spend more than $120 billion in app stores during 2019"," according to App Annie"," a mobile apps analytics firm. '","'Feed me '","'The endless scroll on Facebook"," Instagram"," Twitter ('","')   and other social media apps now consumes 34 minutes of every U.S. adult’s day"," according to Nielsen. Fewer people are sitting on the sofa to watch live TV at set times"," and advertisers are following. Mobile ad spending surpassed TV for the first time in 2018 in terms of percentage share of the U.S. market"," according to research firm eMarketer. We can also thank the smartphone for Instagram influencers"," “sextortion","” and fake news.  '","'Smile for the (smartphone) camera '","'Global shipments of digital cameras dropped from their 2010  peak of 121 million to just 19 million units in 2018"," according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA). Meantime the latest phones pack as many four camera lenses and cutting edge software that makes it easier than ever to get that perfect shot. The front-facing camera might be the busiest: Google reports that its Android devices take 93 million selfies every day.  '","'Graphic: Digital Camera shipments '","' '","'Where am I? '","'The satellite tracking technology known as GPS"," combined with information from cell towers and Wi-Fi networks"," has made the smartphones incredibly powerful tracking devices. Google maps and its poorer cousins enable even the most directionally impaired find their way around unfamiliar locales with ease. '","'For the privacy-minded"," though"," it’s a disaster: Phone companies and app makers routinely record the movements of subscribers and sell that data to advertisers"," a $20 billion-a-year business. The data is “anonymized","” but as numerous studies and a recent New York Times investigation have revealed it is often a simple matter to identify who is behind the dot on the map. Nearly 50% of companies surveyed by Verizon this year used or planned to soon use smartphone management tools to track their employees.  '","'You can look it up '","'The 2010 edition of the venerable Encyclopedia Britannica"," all 32 volumes and 129 pounds of it"," turned out to be the last. But untold barroom arguments or dining room debates can now be settled on the spot: Wikipedia is consulted more than 240 million times daily. '","'Distracting ourselves to death '","'In 2018 alone in the United States"," 2","628 fatal crashes involved a distracted driver"," and of those deadly crashes"," about 13% involved mobile phone use"," according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  '","'Forget your wallet '","'Apple Pay and Google Pay are still afterthoughts for most U.S. consumers"," but China may be a harbinger.

The QR code now peppers storefront windows. Even streetside beggars have adapted"," sometimes rejecting cash and asking that payments be made via WeChat Pay or Alipay. '","'Say what? '","'Among the major casualties of the smartphone era is the conventional phone call itself: ubiquitous messaging apps have helped make video calls"," GIFs"," emojis and audio messaging preferred modes of communication.

white people"," according to a U.S. government study released on Thursday that is likely to increase skepticism of technology widely used by law enforcement agencies. '","'The study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that"," when conducting a particular type of database search known as “one-to-one” matching"," many facial recognition algorithms falsely identified African-American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more than Caucasian faces. '","'The study also found that African-American females are more likely to be misidentified in “one-to-many” matching"," which can be used for identification of a person of interest in a criminal investigation. '","'While some companies have played down earlier findings of bias in technology that can guess an individual’s gender"," known as “facial analysis","” the NIST study was evidence that face matching struggled across demographics"," too. '","'Joy Buolamwini"," founder of the Algorithmic Justice League"," called the report “a comprehensive rebuttal” of those saying artificial intelligence (AI) bias was no longer an issue. The study comes at a time of growing discontent over the technology in the United States"," with critics warning it can lead to unjust harassment or arrests. '","'For the report"," NIST tested 189 algorithms from 99 developers"," excluding companies such as Amazon.com Inc ('","') that did not submit one for review. What it tested differs from what companies sell"," in that NIST studied algorithms detached from the cloud and proprietary training data. '","'China’s SenseTime"," an AI startup valued at more than $7.5 billion"," had “high false match rates for all comparisons” in one of the NIST tests"," the report said.  '","'SenseTime’s algorithm produced a false positive more than 10% of the time when looking at photos of Somali men"," which"," if deployed at an airport"," would mean a Somali man could pass a customs check one in every 10 times he used passports of other Somali men. '","'SenseTime said the report “reflects an isolated case” and that what it submitted had bugs it has addressed. “The results are not reflective of our products"," as they undergo thorough testing before entering the market (and) all report a high degree of accuracy","” it said. '","'Yitu"," another AI startup from China"," was more accurate and had little racial skew. '","'Microsoft Corp ('","') had almost 10 times more false positives for women of color than men of color in some instances during a one-to-many test. Its algorithm showed little discrepancy in a one-to-many test with photos just of black and white males. '","'Microsoft said it was reviewing the report and did not have a comment on Friday morning. '","'Congressman Bennie Thompson"," chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security"," said the findings of bias were worse than feared"," at a time when customs officials are adding facial recognition to travel checkpoints.

'","'In every year apart from 2010 and 2017"," the MSCI Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF has trundled in behind the plain vanilla U.S. benchmark index"," raising questions as to why advisers continually push ostensibly higher-risk markets that reap poorer returns.  '","'“This time of the year"," every single year"," you get the same people...trotting out the same argument as to why you should buy emerging markets","” said John-Paul Smith of emerging market consultancy Ecstrat"," who has correctly called the underperformance of emerging stocks from the end of 2010. '","'Once dismissed as “casinos” because of their volatile economics and politics and frequent illiquidity"," emerging markets have sucked in an estimated $50 billion annually in foreign equity flows since that term for lower and middle-income countries was first coined 38 years ago. '","'That investment has helped emerging economies develop"," with at least some of that cash ploughed into infrastructure"," local business and public services. '","'For much of their early years"," emerging markets proved the brightest stars in the global asset class galaxy - surpassing the S&P 500 up until the 2008 global financial crisis. '","'But the last decade has been more subdued. '","'Investors broadly give three big reasons for that. A stronger dollar"," due in part to U.S. attempts to dial down stimulus in the wake of the 2008 banking crash"," has acted as a headwind for further migration of still-dominant western private savings pools toward emerging markets. '","'More tepid global growth has also magnified a slowdown in China - whose explosive expansion from 2000 was the supercycle of the previous decade but which has since dragged on all emerging economies. '","'Thirdly"," the failure of globalization to fully recover from the 2008 banking crash and recession - evident in a rash of protectionist politics"," civil unrest and faltering trade - has weakened the underlying 30-year investment thesis. '","'“In this environment trade has suffered","” said Ian Hargreaves"," co-head of Asia and emerging market equities at Invesco. “Given the correlation between exports growth and corporate earnings for EM companies"," this has had a negative impact.” '","'Nevertheless"," heading into 2020"," BlackRock - the world’s largest asset manager - is overweight on emerging market equities. Amundi Asset Management"," Europe’s largest"," is “moderately more constructive” on the asset class. JPMorgan"," the U.S.’s largest bank"," is modestly overweight"," while HSBC Asset Management"," part of Europe’s largest bank"," is overweight too. '","'Many within the industry were similarly positive going into 2019 and in many recent years. BlackRock and HSBC Asset Management were overweight this time last year"," Amundi was neutral"," while JPMorgan expected emerging market stocks to deliver double-digit appreciation - which they have done"," just almost half the amount you would have got at home in Boston"," London"," Paris or Frankfurt. '","'“The fund management industry push the emerging markets largely for reasons of self-interest because the margins are so much higher","” said Smith.  '","'For a graphic on Dismal decade for emerging market stocks"," click '","' '","'Their poor performance is raising broader questions about the structure of stock market indexes like MSCI’s"," the most-widely used emerging market index"," with around 1","100 constituents from 26 countries. '","'Such indexes should begin to encompass U.S. giants such as Boeing ('","')"," Coca-Cola ('","') or Chevron ('","') as emerging markets begin to account for a larger chunk of their profits"," said veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius. Developed market stocks are not currently included"," although MSCI does offer separate indexes which cover such stocks with high exposure to emerging markets. '","'“You can continue to say emerging market countries are in the lower and middle-income bracket but if a company has more than 50% of its earnings in emerging markets it should be defined as an emerging market company","” said Mobius"," founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners.  '","'Some emerging market companies have performed well over the past decade. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics ('","')"," for example"," has shot up more than 300%"," although still less than Apple ('","') and Microsoft ('","'). '","'For a graphic on Dismal decade for emerging market stocks"," click '","' '","'MSCI says its framework for classifying markets into emerging and developed is supported by evidence showing that splits based on development and geography resulted in correlation clusters"," allowing investors to seek out diversity. '","'“Superior economic growth has resulted in positive market returns historically"," low correlation within emerging markets and across asset classes has provided diversification benefits"," and relative scarcity of information has created opportunities for active portfolio management","” said Dimitris Melas"," MSCI’s global head of core equity research.  '","'Melas points out that emerging markets have outperformed since the launch of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in December 1987.  '","'The 80s were the start of an investment boom in emerging markets"," which gained traction after the IFC’s Antoine van Agtmael pitched a fund investing in such markets in a meeting at investment bank Salomon Brothers in New York. He piqued the interest of those present but doubts surfaced about the proposed name “Third World Equity Fund","” a term that connoted poverty and hopelessness. '","'Agtmael coined emerging markets"," instead. Soon the likes of Franklin Templeton and Capital Group were dipping their toes in the asset class"," at the vanguard of a growing wall of investment. '","'“It still makes sense to group together the lower-income end of the global investment universe and it has not stopped ‘emerging’","” said Agtmael. “In fact"," it may be bigger and more attractive than ever now that it is no longer ‘hyped’.” '","'Emerging markets remain a growing part of the global economy with a rising middle class"," unlike the U.S."," he notes.  '","'Fund managers are split about the asset class’s fortunes over the next decade. '","'Ecstrat’s Smith remains downbeat"," worrying in particular about the risk of a blow-up among “too big to fail” state-linked firms in China. '","'Others are more positive. '","'“In the last three months emerging markets have outperformed the S&P 500","” said Mobius. “We may be seeing a return to emerging markets mainly because of this low interest rate environment. People are searching for yield.” '","'But if that yield is drowned by repeated capital loss"," illiquidity or excessive volatility"," the burden of proof will climb further.

'","'Born after 1996 on the heels of the millennials"," Gen Z is just entering the workforce. Its members are the first true digital natives"," and their ability to adapt to an automating workplace will likely determine their success.  '","'While science and engineering degrees are on the rise"," “soft” skills such as intellectual insight"," flexibility"," intuition and creativity will be essential for workers competing with machines that are growing more technically proficient.  '","'Here are the soft skills Gen Z members need to succeed:  '","'* Be an effective strategic communicator '","'Some employers fear that digital native workers might be too much like the robots they are competing with. What will make Gen Z workers stand out? Good communication skills.  '","'Those in technology fields often work remotely or in relative isolation"," so they do not always get enough time to sharpen their interpersonal skills"," said Jason Wingard"," dean and professor of the school of professional studies at Columbia University.  '","'There is a way for young people to train for that skill"," though"," added Vicki Walia"," chief talent and capability officer at financial services giant Prudential.  '","'“Gen Zs should not under-emphasize the importance of relationship building"," listening"," communicating"," working collaboratively","” Walia said.  '","'One way to do this is through mentorship. Young workers should work to form relationships with older colleagues or even engage in “reverse mentorships","” helping an older worker learn a new technology skill.  '","'Last year"," Russell Bingham"," a senior engineering major"," participated in the clinic program at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont"," California"," which partners student teams with companies. The interactions were “eye-opening","” Bingham said"," making him find better ways to interact with colleagues.     '","'* Be a continuous learner  '","'While most of Generation Z is still in school"," they already need to think about how to continually adapt to a fast-changing world. Their advantage"," said Walia"," is that they are “digitally capable and multidimensional.”  '","'To succeed"," they must be pragmatic and realistic about their skills and how desired skill sets will change. For example"," Walia said graduates might be trained in Microsoft Excel"," but a job might require them to learn how to interpret that data.  '","'“Storytelling skills are an important part of being able to help others interpret the data"," and use it to tell a story through data visualization","” Walia said.  '","'More industry knowledge also equals more money - up to $6","387 more a year in salary in a high-wage industry - according to a study the MIT-IBM Watson AI lab did between 2010 and 2017.  '","'* Find work that gives you a sense of purpose '","'Nearly half of the Gen Zs said they had experienced job burnout in the past year"," according to a survey by ServiceNow"," a Santa Clara"," California cloud computing company.

'","'Workers are at their best when doing something meaningful to them"," said Obed Louissaint"," vice president of talent at IBM.  '","'To avoid burnout"," young people should couple finding purpose with taking proper mental breaks and trying to build healthy habits"," Louissaint added.  '","'Harvey Mudd student Bingham"," for instance"," is looking for a job that lets him apply his science and engineering skills to projects with societal impact. He recently worked as part of the expedition team that located the HMS Urge submarine after it was lost at sea for 77 years.

'","'Quantum computers remain years away from everyday use but have drawn the interest of major technology companies.

'","'At the launch of the “Markets for Natural Climate Solutions” initiative at U.N. climate talks in Madrid"," IETA said only 3% of total climate finance was going to support such projects. '","'But storing more planet-warming carbon in ecosystems such as soils and trees could deliver about 30% of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius"," it added. '","'“There is a massive discrepancy between what we are spending on this solution and what is on offer","” said Simon Henry"," IETA’s director of carbon market development.  '","'But corporations were beginning to grasp the possibilities"," with major names such as Shell"," Microsoft and Apple pledging hundreds of millions of dollars in the last 18 months to projects such as tree planting"," he said. '","'The founding members of the new IETA initiative include energy corporations BP"," Chevron"," Shell and Woodside Energy"," as well as mining and metals giant BHP and the U.S.-based Arbor Day Foundation"," which has planted more than 300 million trees worldwide. '","'“When it comes to taking action in the climate space"," the world has been very long on say and very short on do","” said Duncan van Bergen"," vice president for nature-based solutions with Shell New Energies. '","'“We believe that nature has a role to play - not instead of"," but in addition to"," a lot of hard work that needs to happen to decarbonise energy"," transportation"," agriculture and other sectors of the economy","” he added. '","'As he spoke at the IETA event"," about two dozen environmental campaigners and indigenous community representatives stood up"," put their hands over their ears and walked out of the room in protest at the promotion of nature-based carbon markets and the involvement of fossil fuel companies. '","'On Thursday"," they issued an open letter signed by 160 green and indigenous rights groups"," including Friends of the Earth International and the Indigenous Environmental Network"," calling for carbon markets to be kept out of the formal guidelines for implementing the Paris Agreement from 2020. '","'Carbon markets allow governments"," companies and other entities to earn and sell or trade credits for tonnes of avoided"," reduced or stored climate-changing emissions. '","'But critics charge that granting credits to “carbon offset” projects such as forest protection can allow big polluters to buy those"," instead of substantially cutting their own emissions by using less fossil fuel and other measures. '","'Governments at the two-week talks in the Spanish capital are haggling over the rules that will govern how carbon markets should operate to make the world carbon-neutral by mid-century and meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.  '","'The campaigners’ letter said giving carbon markets the green light in Madrid “would lock us into even more emissions"," further temperature rise"," continued fossil fuel use and decades of inaction"," distraction and corporate power-grabbing”. '","'Under the world’s existing carbon trading schemes"," the largest of which covers the European Union"," “global emissions have continued to rise”"," they noted. '","'Last month"," the World Meteorological Organization said greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record in 2018"," exceeding the average yearly increase of the last decade and reinforcing increasingly damaging weather patterns. '","'Dipti Bhatnagar"," who works on climate justice issues for Friends of the Earth International"," said that in Mozambique - where she lives - multinationals Shell and Eni were starting a large natural gas project while showing interest in offsetting emissions from their operations by planting trees in Africa. '","'“This is completely problematic. ... We are saying this is not the way to do things","” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. '","'Carbon market experts said discussions on “Article 6”"," the part of the Paris Agreement that covers carbon markets"," had failed to make much progress in the first few days in Madrid. '","'Countries are at odds over how the emissions reductions projects generate should be accounted for"," with some pushing for a system that prohibits “double counting” with both the country that is home to the projects and the country that buys the credits counting them toward their national targets. '","'Another point of contention is whether billions of carbon offsets created as part of the “Clean Development Mechanism” under the Kyoto Protocol"," the treaty that preceded the Paris Agreement"," can be carried over into the new system. '","'China"," India and Brazil"," which own many of these credits"," want to be able to sell them to help meet their Paris targets"," but other countries say they should be canceled or efforts to quickly reduce emissions will fail. '","'Sam Van den plas"," policy director with Carbon Market Watch"," an international advocacy group"," said carrying those credits over would be the equivalent of allowing 700 coal power plants to operate continuously for 10 years. '","'“This risks undermining the Paris Agreement from the inside","” he told journalists. “Cheating the climate system does not get us anywhere.” '","'At a protest inside the conference"," activists and leaders of U.S. indigenous communities chanted “Article Six"," you cannot fix” and tore up a piece of paper representing it.  '","'Simon Lewis"," a professor who researches tropical forests at University College London"," said even successful markets for carbon offsets derived from tree planting and other natural systems could not substitute for switching away from fossil fuels"," if emissions were to be cut to net-zero. '","'“This nature-based solutions is becoming a smokescreen for just continuing business as usual","” he added"," saying oil and gas companies needed to change their business models. '","'Arthur Lee"," a senior technical advisor on climate change with Chevron"," said his company was acting to shrink its carbon footprint"," like others in the sector.  '","'Measures ranged from reducing flaring and emissions from oil and gas production to using more renewable energy in its operations"," he said. '","'“We are doing a lot more than a lot of people say that we are","” he added.  '","'IETA said its new initiative would work to ensure benefits for local communities involved.  '","'Jeremy Manion"," who leads on forestry carbon markets for the Arbour Day Foundation"," said cutting global emissions to net-zero was a “massive challenge” and would require “unlikely partnerships and collaborations”.

'","'Baer"," a trans woman"," gave up flying after a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer identified her as a woman for the body scanner"," which then triggered an alarm because her groin did not match the machine’s version of the female body.  '","'“I was stopped in front of the entire line of people and two TSA agents touched my crotch repeatedly","” Baer"," who began transitioning in 2017"," told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. '","'“The (security officer) finally started laughing to himself and pressed the blue button so that the machine would stop registering my penis as a potential threat. The TSA agents were still laughing as I walked away.” '","'Discrimination concerns are mounting with the growing use of technology by police"," security and immigration services that fails to recognize trans and nonbinary people"," who do not define themselves as male or female. '","'Trans travelers are often scrutinized at airports as their bodies and luggage - including prosthetics and chest binders - get flagged by body scanners for extra screening"," said the National Center for Transgender Equality in a 2015 survey. '","'It found four in 10 trans travelers had a problem with airport security in the last year due to their gender identity"," including being patted down"," asked to show an undergarment"," having the gender on their ID questioned and being detained. '","'“It made me feel scrutinized and a little violated","” said Parker Kehrig"," a trans man"," who had several scans and was patted down multiple times in Detroit and New York airports this year.  '","'Such problems have led to calls for a new law - the 2018 Screening With Dignity Act"," which would require the TSA to develop new procedures for screening trans passengers"," including assessing the cost of developing gender neutral equipment. '","'The TSA said a tiny fraction of the complaints it received in the last financial year were from trans passengers - 28 out of more than 100","000 incidents - and that it trains its officers in collaboration with trans rights groups. '","'“TSA is committed to ensuring all travelers are treated with dignity"," respect and courtesy","” it said in emailed comments"," adding that its procedures were based on the technology available to detect aviation threats. '","'Trans travelers can also provide documentation from a doctor to alert the security officers of their gender identity before being screened and request a supervisor to monitor the process"," the TSA said.  '","'Trans rights groups were quick to flag up the problem of using scanners that fail to recognize non-traditional bodies"," leading officers to pat-down the area where the anomaly was detected"," when the technology was introduced a decade ago. '","'“We saw immediately there were problems in the invasive nature of (the scanners) and the scrutiny of trans people’s bodies","” said Harper Jean Tobin"," policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality. '","'But there has been little progress to resolve the issue. '","'Tobin said the TSA’s data on the number of trans complaints was misleading as many trans travelers do not feel comfortable reporting issues going through airport security"," and many of those who have complained were not satisfied with the response. '","'Maggie Down"," a trans woman"," filed a complaint after being subjected to a “thoroughly violating” body search in a private room at the Columbus"," Ohio airport. '","'Down said she was “wordlessly ordered to lift (her) skirt”"," after which a security officer had to pat her down twice because she forgot to scan her gloves the first time round. '","'“I received a rather boilerplate response from the TSA","” Down said. “(It) stated that what happened was standard procedure and recommended I read through the TSA’s FAQ about travel for trans passengers.”  '","'The TSA asked her for further information"," which she provided"," and she has been waiting one month for a reply. '","'The TSA was not immediately able to respond to a request for comment on Down’s complaint. '","'Trans rights groups fear that the situation could worsen as the TSA is rolling out facial recognition software at airports across the United States. '","'Researchers at the U.S. University of Colorado Boulder tested facial recognition systems from tech giants IBM"," Amazon and Microsoft on photographs of trans men and found they were misidentified as women 38% of the time. '","'The study suggested that the software relies on outdated gender stereotypes in its facial analysis"," adding that the report’s lead author Morgan Klaus Scheuerman"," who is male with long hair"," was categorized as female half of the time. '","'“Maybe you have socially transitioned"," but it doesn’t necessarily match what your documentation says - there could be issues with TSA"," immigration and customs","” he said.

'","'“Will this displace the traditional IPO?

'","'A direct listing has so far differed from an IPO because it does not raise fresh funds; rather"," it is a way for existing investors to monetize their shares.

'","'In this new direct model"," all of the shares being offered by a company - so-called primary shares - are to be sold in the first trade to a variety of buyers.

'","'The nonprofit RISC-V Foundation (pronounced risk-five) wants to ensure that universities"," governments and companies outside the United States can help develop its open-source technology"," its Chief Executive Calista Redmond said in an interview with Reuters. '","'She said the foundation’s global collaboration has faced no restrictions to date but members are “concerned about possible geopolitical disruption.” '","'“From around the world"," we’ve heard that ‘If the incorporation was not in the U.S."," we would be a lot more comfortable’","” she said. Redmond said the foundation’s board of directors approved the move unanimously but declined to disclose which members prompted it. '","'Created in 2015"," the RISC-V Foundation sets standards for the core chip architecture and controls who can use the RISC-V trademark on products"," as other organizations do for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips. It does not own or control the technology.  '","'More than 325 companies or other entities pay to be members"," including U.S. and European chip suppliers such as Qualcomm Inc ('","') and NXP Semiconductors ('","')"," as well as China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ('","') and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. '","'The foundation’s move from Delaware to Switzerland may foreshadow further technology flight because of U.S. restrictions on dealing with some Chinese technology companies"," said William Reinsch"," who was undersecretary of commerce for export administration in the Clinton administration. '","'“There is a message for the government. The message is"," if you clamp down on things too tightly this is what is going to happen. In a global supply chain world"," companies have choices"," and one choice is to go overseas","” he said. '","'In a statement to Reuters"," the U.S. Department of Commerce said its controls were designed to safeguard U.S. national security and to “ensure bad actors cannot acquire technology that harms U.S. citizens or interests"," while promoting innovation to fuel continued American technological leadership.” The department said it meets regularly with private industry to gauge market conditions and the effects of its regulations. '","'Some Republican U.S. lawmakers said they are concerned the United States will lose influence over RISC-V chip architecture"," which can be used to make microprocessors for almost every type of electronic device"," making it a crucial building block of a modern economy. The technology came from labs at the University of California"," Berkeley"," and later benefited from funding by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). '","'The lawmakers warn that the foundation’s Chinese members could influence the technology’s development to help China’s semiconductor industry. '","'“The Chinese Communist Party is trying to circumvent our export control system to support national security threats like Huawei - we cannot let it succeed","” Representative Mike Gallagher"," a Republican from Wisconsin"," told Reuters. '","'Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton said moving the foundation to ensure it could retain Chinese members was “short-sighted at best.” He added that “if American public funds were used to develop the technology"," it’s also completely outrageous.”  '","'Redmond said in follow-up emails after speaking to Reuters that given the technology is open source and available to anyone"," she does not see how the move could be against the U.S. national interest. '","'A DARPA spokesman told Reuters the agency intended for RISC-V work it funded to be publicly available to companies and academics around the world.  '","'Morgan Reed"," president of The App Association"," which receives funding from major U.S. technology firms such as Apple Inc ('","') and Microsoft Corp ('","') in Washington"," likened the RISC-V Foundation’s work to efforts between U.S. and Chinese companies to jointly develop Wi-Fi chip standards.  '","'“The notion that China can be barred from participating in standards alongside the U.S. and the EU is simply not viable","” Reed said. “China is too important as a manufacturer and an end-market to ignore.” '","'The RISC-V Foundation announced at a meeting last December it would seek a “neutral” country before making a formal decision to go to Switzerland earlier this year"," a decision that got little public attention. Final approvals in Switzerland for the move are expected as soon as the end of November"," Redmond said. '","'Chinese companies have had access to the RISC-V architecture"," which is publicly available"," since its creation"," Redmond said.  '","'Alibaba claimed in July it had developed the fastest RISC-V processor to date. The company declined to comment for this story. '","'The RISC-V Foundation’s move shows how U.S.-China trade tensions could make the United States a harder place to host technology standards groups"," according to two attorneys who represent such groups. '","'The lawyers said it is unclear whether standards groups are allowed to work with Huawei. These groups are concerned U.S. authorities may decide that some closed-door technical discussions involve the transfer of sensitive technology to the Chinese or others on banned lists"," said one of the attorneys"," Brad Biddle"," who works for several standards groups.  '","'In June"," more than two dozen standards groups - including those overseeing SD memory cards and Ethernet and HDMI cables - wrote a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking for clarification of the rules on working with Huawei. '","'The groups warned Ross that the Huawei restrictions posed a “serious risk” that standards work could move out of the United States"," which could end a long-held trend where U.S.-based groups set de facto standards for the rest of the world"," they wrote. '","'The Commerce Department published an advisory opinion seeking to clarify the issue in August"," but standards lawyers said the rules remain confusing. '","'The RISC-V Foundation’s Redmond does not yet see a “credible threat” to international collaboration. “But we’re taking out an insurance policy against that type of action by moving our incorporation","” she told Reuters.  '","'The board’s seven current members are all based in North America. After the move"," the foundation’s board will be expanded and European and Asian members will be added"," said Redmond. Reuters could not confirm whether any Chinese companies planned to join the board. '","'Andrew Updegrove"," an attorney who does work for standards groups"," said that U.S. restrictions on transferring U.S.-origin technology to Chinese companies will still apply regardless of where the RISC-V Foundation is headquartered. '","'At Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors"," which is a member of the foundation"," customers have asked the company to detail where the technology in its chips comes from"," said Lars Reger"," its chief technology officer. The customers do not want to be cut off in future trade disputes"," he said. '","'U.S. officials and some lawmakers have alleged Huawei’s telecom equipment may enable surveillance by China. The resulting backlash has prevented it from making inroads into the U.S. market. Huawei has denied the claims. '","'In response to Reuters questions"," a Huawei spokesman said: “We support RISC-V Foundation identifying Switzerland as a neutral venue for open source development. Making open source as open as possible is important for the industry.” '","'He said that RISC-V “might fit well into Huawei’s vision of this heterogeneous"," open world.” '","'(This story corrects paragraph 16 to reflect that Apple and Microsoft are sponsors of The App Association"," rather than members.)

'","'By Joseph Menn '","'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A group advocating ethical investing will ask backers of tech analytics company Palantir Technologies to push for changes to its business practices"," a rare case of coordinated shareholder action against a privately held company. '","'The Investor Alliance for Human Rights"," which claims more than 150 institutional members representing $4 trillion in managed assets"," faults Palantir for contracts with government agencies including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  '","'“Through its multimillion-dollar U.S. government contracts"," Palantir has played a mission critical role in enabling ICE to carry out its activities","” the group said in a presentation provided to Reuters in advance of its announcement. “The company is failing to fulfill its human rights responsibilities.” '","'Palantir said the report was misleading. “We always welcome an honest and open dialogue when it comes to complex societal issues"," so it is disappointing to see a one-sided view","” said Courtney Bowman"," Palantir’s director of privacy and civil liberties engineering.                '","'Though Palantir itself is private"," the group says investors include such publicly traded entities as BlackRock"," Allianz and Alger. The company is looking to raise another private financing round that would value the company at $25 billion"," Reuters reported in September. It was co-founded by prominent venture capitalist Peter Thiel"," who spoke at the 2016 Republican convention in support of then-candidate Donald Trump. '","'“The relative impunity of private companies heightens the risks of human rights impacts"," increasing the need for private equity investors to push those companies through other means to respect human rights","” said alliance Director Paloma Munoz Quick. '","'The alliance last year criticized Amazon.com Inc’s human rights record"," helping prompt unsuccessful shareholder resolutions on activities including the company’s sale of facial-recognition software.

'","'“They are not immune from reputational damage because it’s a venture project","” Elliot said. '","'Microsoft ('","') and Alphabet’s ('","') Google have also drawn attention this year for venture investments in startups that critics say might have fallen afoul of those companies’ stated principles on facial recognition and artificial intelligence technologies. '","'Microsoft invested in Israeli firm AnyVision"," whose facial recognition gear has been deployed by Israeli authorities at Palestinian checkpoints. '","'After media reports that AnyVision’s gear was used for mass surveillance in Palestinian territory"," Microsoft said such use “would violate our facial recognition principles” and last week hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to audit AnyVision’s compliance with its ethics guidelines. '","'Google investment arm Gradient Ventures"," meanwhile"," has backed Cogniac"," whose software is used to quickly process images from the battlefield. Google’s published principles include a commitment not to deploy AI for “weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.”  '","'Google said Gradient investments follow the parent company principles but declined to discuss the Pentagon image processing.

U.S. hospitals invest in land, housing to treat crisis","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'8 Min Read'","'WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Whitney Brown decided to move back to her hometown in Virginia after graduating from university two years ago"," she ran into an obstacle: There was nowhere for her to live. '","'She could not move back into her old home in Richmond"," the state’s prosperous capital"," because her mother was looking to sell her house - nor could she find a place of her own that was both affordable and in a safe area. '","'Developers were “building bigger houses"," super-close together"," that locals couldn’t afford","” Brown"," 24"," told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. '","'Eventually"," a real estate agent pointed her toward a different option: the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust"," a nonprofit that buys homes"," fixes them up and then sells them at a reduced price while keeping the titles to the underlying land. '","'Community land trusts are on the rise across the United States as cities look for ways to ease an ongoing crisis of affordable housing. '","'But the Maggie Walker land trust is unusual in how it was created: It was funded in large part by a hospital system"," Bon Secours Mercy Health. '","'This month"," Bon Secours was one of 14 healthcare systems across the United States that committed to over $700 million in “place-based” investments"," with a primary goal being the development of affordable housing. '","'They are all part of a group called the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN)"," a project of the Washington-based research group Democracy Collaborative. '","'Since 2017 the network has grown to more than 40 health systems seeking to use their financial might and public sway to improve housing in their communities"," according to David Zuckerman"," the director. '","'“We wanted to help them think about ... how they could leverage their assets differently to better address the needs coming at them","” Zuckerman said. '","'For Brown"," buying her house through a land trust meant she paid about 20% less than a comparable home in the area. '","'Now settling into a place with a yard"," two bedrooms and a new kitchen - on a block where four other homes are also part of the Maggie Walker project - Brown cannot believe her luck.  '","'The land trust"," she said"," “has really added value to the neighborhood"," without pushing people out.” '","'Gentrification - the conversion of working-class districts into more affluent areas - is regarded as a sign of economic development by some and of social injustice by others"," as it can lead to higher rents that price out old residents. '","'In a report published in March"," the National Community Reinvestment Coalition in Washington showed that Richmond’s rapid rate of gentrification has had a particularly devastating effect on black families.  '","'It became clear to officials at Bon Secours that the group’s Richmond hospital was sitting in an underserved neighborhood"," said Becky Clay Christensen"," director for community health at Bon Secours Richmond. '","'“Literally right outside the doors"," you could see dilapidated housing","” she recalled.  '","'Wanting to be a “good neighbor”"," the hospital started to make one-off housing investments"," she explained. '","'But it soon realized it was contributing to the problem. When the houses it had helped refurbish were resold"," they would again be out of reach for many low-income people"," thus fuelling the negative effects of gentrification.  '","'The Maggie Walker land trust was already being developed at that time"," and Bon Secours saw an opportunity to have a longer-term impact"," said Christensen.  '","'Homeownership within the land trust is limited to those making less than 80% of the area median income"," which Christensen said includes families that can handle debt but “can’t quite get a loan at the bank”. '","'In these types of projects"," a prospective homeowner buys only the home and not the land"," often agreeing to a reduced price for any future resale"," according to the Grounded Solutions Network based in Portland"," Oregon.  '","'By the end of 2018"," the year it launched"," the Maggie Walker land trust had helped 11 homeowners buy their own places and had 30 more homes under development. '","'Christensen described Bon Secours’ new approach as a “neighborhood strategy” around health and wellness"," noting that the effects are ultimately long-term. '","'“If a nonprofit rehabilitates Ms. Smith’s house"," she’s not instantly healthier. But because of her rehabbed house"," (she) is now in a more stable situation","” Christensen said"," using a hypothetical example. '","'“We know that the constant stress that goes with poverty is profound and real. So"," in a strange way"," this all does come back to health.” '","'Along with Bon Secours"," some of the largest hospitals and health systems in the country have promised to invest more in their communities as part of the Healthcare Anchor Network. '","'They include Trinity Health"," Boston Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente"," one of the country’s largest nonprofit health plans. '","'The strategy for the network"," which represents more than 700 hospitals — about 20% of the country’s total"," said director Zuckerman — is based on the community-building power of what the Democracy Collaborative refers to as “anchor” institutions. '","'These are “nonprofit or public institutions (that) have a long-term interest in balancing their own organizational needs with that of their communities — they can’t just pick up and leave","” Zuckerman said.  '","'Today"," anchor institutions are often the largest employer and landowner in their area"," and they have become key engines of urban development and redevelopment"," according to Democracy Collaborative. '","'Other types of large institutions have increasingly been moving in the same direction"," Zuckerman said. '","'For example"," several universities"," as well as a rising number of major technology companies - such as Microsoft - have been making larger investments in affordable housing. '","'But there is particular potential among healthcare systems"," Zuckerman noted. '","'Together"," the health systems in the United States have about $400 billion in investment assets"," estimates the Democracy Collaborative. '","'The HAN encourages its members to direct at least 1-to-2% of their investment portfolios to supporting affordable housing"," in addition to other efforts to bolster local economies"," Zuckerman said. '","'The growing focus on the link between health and housing is happening outside the network"," too. '","'The state of New Jersey is partnering with a half-dozen healthcare systems to build affordable housing"," for instance"," and the city of Baltimore is working with 10 hospitals to provide housing as part of an initiative to end homelessness. '","'In announcing the new effort"," several HAN members cast their actions as extending “beyond the walls” of the hospital"," seeking to address health issues and inequities. '","'“The 85-year life expectancy for a resident of Chicago’s downtown drops to 69 years just six miles away","” Rush University Medical Center chief executive Omar Lateef said in a statement. '","'“These death gaps are unnatural"," unjust and must be addressed by improving the economic conditions in the neighborhoods we serve"," not only the health conditions of the people who live there.” '","'Reporting by Carey L.

company that challenged the Pentagon’s military space launch procurement strategy"," showing support for one of the Amazon billionaire’s disputes with major agency procurement programs. '","'The Government Accountability Office (GAO) sustained part of a bid protest from Blue Origin that argued the Air Force’s decision to pick just two of four competing rocket companies to launch the country’s next lineup of defense satellites for the next five years is “flawed”. '","'Bezos’ Amazon.com Inc also challenged the Pentagon’s recent decision to award a $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft Corp"," claiming politics spoiled a fair contracting process. '","'Blue Origin"," founded by Bezos in 2000"," filed its protest in August"," claiming the Air Force program “contains a number of flaws preventing offerers from intelligently preparing their proposals” and “squashes nascent competition by locking out non-selected providers for over 5 years.” '","'The total contract value for the program"," called Launch Services Procurement (LSP) Phase 2"," is unknown but is expected to be worth billions of dollars"," assigning the Pentagon’s next 34 launches of defense satellites from 2022 to 2027 to two companies. '","'The GAO said Monday the Air Force program’s “basis for award is inconsistent with applicable procurement law and regulation” and recommended the agency change the rules of its solicitation. '","'If the Air Force disagrees with the GAO’s recommendation"," it would be the first time an agency did so since 2015"," setting the stage for the U.S. Congress to intervene. Of the nearly 2","000 protest affirmations from the GAO since 2015"," only one agency formally declined to implement GAO’s recommendations. '","'The Air Force has said it “does not plan to revise the terms of the LSP solicitation due to this protest","” believing its current approach is best for national security and open competition. '","'Congress in 2014 moved to wean the U.S. off its dependency on rockets using Russia’s RD-180 engine for military launches before 2022 by initiating the Air Force LSP"," which expects to pick the two award winners by the end of 2020. '","'United Launch Alliance (ULA)"," a joint venture between Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp whose Atlas 5 rocket uses the RD-180"," has long dominated the military launch market"," lofting the bulk of U.S. defense satellites to space since its formation in 2006.

Supreme Court to hear Google bid to end Oracle copyright suit","ticker":"MSFT","content":["'4 Min Read'","'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear Google’s bid to escape Oracle Corp’s multi-billion dollar lawsuit accusing Google of infringing software copyrights to build the Android operating system that runs most of the world’s smartphones. '","'Google has appealed a lower court ruling reviving the suit in which Oracle has sought at least $8 billion in damages. A jury cleared Google in 2016"," but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington overturned that decision in 2018"," finding that Google’s inclusion of Oracle’s software code in Android did not constitute a fair use under U.S. copyright law.  '","'The justices will hear arguments in the case during their current term"," with a ruling due by the end of June. '","'Oracle and Google"," two California-based technology giants with combined annual revenues of more than $175 billion"," have been feuding since Oracle sued for copyright infringement in 2010 in San Francisco federal court. The Supreme Court in 2015 rebuffed a previous Google appeal in the case. The outcome of the suit could help shape the level of copyright protection for software. '","'Google"," part of Alphabet Inc"," said an Oracle victory would chill software innovation. The company welcomed the court’s decision to hear the appeal. “Developers should be able to create applications across platforms and not be locked into one company’s software","” Senior Vice President Kent Walker said in a statement.  '","'Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said the company is confident the Supreme Court will preserve software copyrights and “reject Google’s continuing efforts to avoid responsibility for copying Oracle’s innovations.”  '","'Google was backed by Microsoft Corp and groups that defend the rights of internet users. President Donald Trump’s administration backed Oracle in the case"," urging the justices in a written brief to turn away Google’s appeal.  '","'Oracle accused Google of copying thousands of lines of computer code from its popular Java programming language without a license in order to make Android"," a competing platform that has harmed Oracle’s business.  '","'The case has whipsawed since the start with Google twice losing at the Federal Circuit. In 2014"," the appeals court reversed a federal judge’s ruling that Oracle’s interfaces could not be copyrighted. Google appealed that finding to the Supreme Court"," but after the Justice Department under former President Barack Obama recommended against hearing the case"," the justices declined.  '","'The Federal Circuit in 2018 said Google’s incorporation of Oracle’s “application programming interfaces” was not permitted under the so-called fair use doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act"," rejecting Google’s argument that by adapting them to a mobile platform it transformed them into something new.  '","'The stakes are now too high for the justices to ignore"," Google said in its latest appeal"," calling the Federal Circuit’s rulings a “devastating one-two punch at the software industry.”  '","'The shortcut commands that Google copied into Android do not warrant copyright protection because they help developers write programs to work across platforms"," a key to software innovation and the information age"," Google said in a legal filings"," adding that its use was fair.  '","'Google said its actions “prevented Oracle from locking in developers familiar with the Java language into building applications only for Oracle’s platform.” '","'Oracle said the concerns raised about innovation were overblown and that if a commercial platform developer does not want to license Java"," it can make its own platform without copying.

'","'“Even if nine of us don’t release that data"," one person may allow their data to be released and that’s it for all of us.” '","'Weyl wants people to form “data unions” to demand payment for their data and help address privacy concerns by restricting what information is collected and how it is used.

'","'“There is a need to ensure that investors and managers remain accountable"," so that the good of minors and society is not sacrificed to profit.” '","'Francis said the Church’s “painful and tragic experience” with its own sexual abuse crisis gave it a “duty to approach these issues with a long-term vision”. '","'Last month"," the United States"," Britain and Australia called on Facebook to suspend plans to encrypt its messaging service"," saying it would hinder the fight against child abuse and terrorism. '","'Child predators have increasingly used messaging applications to groom their victims and exchange explicit images and videos.

'","'The conference at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences is the Vatican’s latest foray into moral issues related to technology.

'","'“But the biggest onus is on the state: one of the lessons from Brexit is that people feel disconnected from policymaking.” '","'Kind called on governments to adopt a “precautionary approach” to adopting new technologies.

'","'A source familiar with the matter said it may be easier for Microsoft than other tech platforms to comply with California’s privacy laws because much of Microsoft’s business can qualify as a “service provider.” CCPA offers special treatment to companies that can classify themselves as “service providers.” '","'A service provider is defined as having a written agreement with a business"," stating that it will not retain"," use"," or disclose the personal information of consumers for any purpose other than for a specific purpose set forth in the contract. '","'Service providers are one of three types of entities generally affected by the CCPA. The others are businesses and third parties.  '","'There are certain advantages to being considered a service provider as opposed to a third party.  '","'For instance"," if a business shares personal information with a third party"," that can trigger certain disclosures that must be made to the consumer. Such third parties also must provide notice to consumers before selling personal information they receive"," which in turn could allow consumers to opt out.  '","'Transferring personal information to a service provider"," by contrast"," does not necessarily trigger those additional obligations"," making it easier to comply with the law.
